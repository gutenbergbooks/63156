</div>


<p>An algebra recitation was in progress in D section.</p>

<p>Reed was on his feet explaining the given problem
with his usual quickness and accuracy. Suddenly
Mr. Horton interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Very well, Reed, take your seat. Crawford, you
may continue the explanation.”</p>

<p>Crawford stumbled to his feet with a confused
glance at the teacher.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;don’t know exactly where Reed left off,
sir,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“If you had been paying attention you would
have known. Failure, Crawford. Freeman, you may
continue,” said Mr. Horton.</p>

<p>Freeman&mdash;a slender, pale-faced boy&mdash;occupied
the seat directly in front of Crawford’s. He rose
promptly and began where Reed had left off, but in
a moment he stopped, the color rose in his face, he
hesitated, stammered and dropped back into his
seat, saying, “I can’t do it, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[2]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Horton, whose eyes had been on some restless
boys in another part of the room, turned around
with a glance of surprise. Freeman was not an especially
quick scholar, and his frequent absences on
account of illness kept him from taking the rank in
the class that his steady work would otherwise have
secured for him, but a failure was a rare thing for
him.</p>

<p>“I think you can do that, Freeman. Try again,”
said the teacher.</p>

<p>The boy rose, and once more attempted to go on
with the problem, but as before, his face flushed and
he dropped quickly back into his seat.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Freeman, but I must give you a failure,”
said Mr. Horton; but as he spoke, another boy
sitting across the aisle from Crawford rose, and said
clearly and distinctly, “Mr. Horton, Freeman can
solve that problem, I think, if he can stand by your
desk.”</p>

<p>At this, low hisses sounded from different parts of
the room, but a glance from Mr. Horton suppressed
them, as he said quietly, “Freeman, step forward to
my desk and finish the recitation if you can.”</p>

<p>With a look of relief, the little fellow stepped forward,
and, without a moment’s hesitation, solved the
problem clearly and correctly.</p>

<p>He cast a grateful glance at the boy who had
spoken for him as he returned to his seat, but he<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
shivered as he saw the ugly, threatening look in
Crawford’s eyes, and caught the words hissed close
to his ear, as Crawford leaned over his desk: “I’ll
settle with you for that, and with that donkey that
brayed for you, too.”</p>

<p>At recess, Mr. Horton kept both Freeman and
Clark, the boy who had spoken for him, and questioned
them, but he could get no information from
either. He was certain however, in his own mind,
that Crawford was the one to blame. He believed
that Crawford was at the bottom of much of the
trouble and disorder in his class-room, but it was all
so slyly done that it was next to impossible to fix
the blame where it belonged.</p>

<p>“It was real good of you, Stanley, to help me out,”
Freeman said gratefully, as, Mr. Horton having dismissed
them, the two went down to the playground;
“but I’m afraid Crawford’ll serve you some mean
trick to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“He served you a mean enough one, this morning,”
answered Clark. “Sticking pins into you, wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Freeman; “he had ’em fastened
somehow to the toe of his shoe. They must have
been big pins too, for they hurt like fury. Look
here!” He pointed to some dark spots on his black
stockings, below his short trousers.</p>

<p>“Blood?” said Clark, inquiringly, and as Freeman
nodded, he added:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a shame, Ray. I see him tormenting you in
all sorts of ways whenever Horton isn’t looking.
You ought to have your seat changed. Why don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” said Freeman, quickly. “He’d say I
was a coward then, and couldn’t stand a little fun.
No, I’ll stick it out&mdash;but,” he added, half laughing,
“I wish he wouldn’t stick so many things into me.
I reckon I know how a pin-cushion feels.”</p>

<p>Crawford, with half a dozen of his particular
cronies, stood on the playground near the door.
They seized upon Clark and Freeman as they came
out.</p>

<p>“Well, Sissies, did you tell the master all about
it?” demanded Crawford, scornfully.</p>

<p>“We did not tell him anything,” answered Clark
quietly, looking straight into the other’s angry eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie. You did, too!” said Crawford, hotly.</p>

<p>“We didn’t either!” began Freeman, indignantly;
but the big fellow who was holding him gave him
a shake and told him to “hush up,” while Crawford
repeated loudly and distinctly, “It’s a lie!”</p>

<p>A crowd quickly gathered about the group.
There was a moment of silence, while all waited to
see what Clark would do. His face was very white
and his hands were clenched, but still looking
straight into Crawford’s angry eyes, he answered
steadily, “You can believe me or not, as you like.
I have told you the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a sneak, a coward and a telltale! Take
that!” said Crawford, in reply, and as he spoke he
struck Clark across the mouth.</p>

<p>Clark’s eyes fairly blazed then. He took one step
forward, and grasped Crawford’s wrists with a grip
that made him wince and draw back, but the next
instant Clark released him and turned away, saying,
“I would not lower myself enough to fight with you.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Coward&mdash;coward! You’re afraid, and
try to sneak out of it that way,” called Crawford
loudly; and more than one voice joined in the cry,
and shouted, “Coward! Coward!” as Clark walked
swiftly through the hall and up the stairs to his
seat. Little Freeman followed him, but as he
glanced at his friend’s white, set face, he dared not
speak to him, and slipping into his own seat, he
opened a book, and pretended to be studying. In
another moment, the bell summoned the boys from
the playground. Those of section D, as they returned
to their seats, cast curious or scornful glances
at Clark, but he never raised his eyes to look at one
of them, and when school was dismissed he was the
first to leave the room, not waiting even for little
Freeman, who was his devoted admirer, and counted
it a great honor, as well as pleasure, to walk home
with him.</p>

<p>Freeman was feeling very badly about the affair.
He considered himself to blame for it all, and he<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
longed to tell Clark how sorry he was, but he knew
instinctively that his friend could not bear to talk
of it then; so he did not attempt to overtake him,
but walked slowly on alone, so deep in thought that
he did not notice quick footsteps behind him, till
his cap was suddenly snatched off and flung into a
mud-puddle, while Crawford’s loud, rough voice
exclaimed, “Now, little telltale, you’ve got to take
<em>your</em> punishment. I told you I’d pay you out, and
I meant it.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t do anything to you,” protested
Freeman, shrinking from the other’s rough grasp.</p>

<p>“Didn’t do anything to me!” echoed Crawford
harshly. “It was all your fault. That fool of a
Clark was standing up for you, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” began Freeman.</p>

<p>“You hush up! We’ve had chin enough from
you,” interrupted Crawford, and while three or four
of his cronies stood by laughing and jeering, he
seized the little fellow, who was five years younger
than himself, and nothing like his size, and rolled
him over and over in the puddle, where he had
already thrown his cap. It had rained heavily the
night before, and there was water enough to soak
Freeman’s clothing pretty thoroughly. Not content
with this, Crawford rubbed mud over the lad’s face
and hands, and tried to force it into his mouth
before he released him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed at last. “Now run and
tell Clark all about it.”</p>

<p>“Telltale! Telltale!” chorused the others, as Freeman,
exhausted by his ineffectual struggles, and
dripping wet, picked up his cap and books, and
hurried off. He looked at no one that he met, but
all the same he was keenly conscious of the curious
glances at his flushed face and dripping clothes as
he went.</p>

<p>When he reached home he found no one there but
his twin sister, Edith.</p>

<p>“Why, Ray!” she exclaimed, “what is the matter?
How did you get so wet? But don’t stop to tell
me,” she added hastily; “run right up stairs, and
get on dry clothes first, and I’ll have some hot drink
ready when you come down.”</p>

<p>She knew the danger of a chill for the delicate
boy, and had the hot drink ready, and made him
take it before she would let him tell her a word of
what had happened. Indeed, he did not want to
tell her at all, but these two had always shared each
other’s joys and sorrows, so Edith soon knew the
whole story, all except Crawford’s name. That
Freeman would not tell for all her urging. She was
so indignant, and scolded so long about it all, that
her brother at last half forgot his own indignation in
laughing at hers.</p>

<p>“I think it’s too shameful for anything, and the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
boy ought to be suspended&mdash;I don’t care who he is!”
she declared, her blue eyes flashing. “Ray, I think
you <em>ought</em> to let Mr. Horton know about it, just so
that this fellow will not dare to treat any other boy
as he has treated you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Edith, they sha’n’t have any grounds for
calling me telltale,” Freeman answered, his thin face
flushing as he heard again, in imagination, the taunting
cry of “telltale,” that seemed still ringing in his
ears. “Say, Edith,” he went on, “mind you don’t
let mother know anything about this. She’d worry
over it, and imagine me suffering all sorts of persecutions,
and it isn’t likely that that fellow will
trouble me any more, now that he’s had his ‘revenge,’
as he calls it.”</p>

<p>“But, Ray,” said his sister, “we can’t help mother’s
knowing. You can’t wear those clothes again until
they’ve been cleaned and pressed. They’ll have to
be sent away for that, and mother must know about
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and pay the bill,” groaned the boy. “I tell
you, Edith, it’s awful hard on a big fellow like me
to be just a bill of expense to mother, instead of
being at work, helping her, as I feel I ought to
be.”</p>

<p>“But <em>she</em> doesn’t feel that you ought to be,” said
Edith. “You know it almost breaks her heart because
she can’t send you to college, and I don’t think<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
anything would induce her to let you leave school
until you graduate.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” sighed the boy, “and the worst of it
is that I am such a weakling that I may never
amount to anything in the world when I am through
school.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry over that, Ray. You are certainly
stronger than you were a year or two ago, and maybe
you won’t have any more sick spells to pull you
down. I do hope not, any way,” and Edith laid her
hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke.</p>

<p>He looked up at her gratefully, as he answered,
“I wonder what I should do without you, Edith.
You never let me get <em>quite</em> discouraged.”</p>

<p>“And never mean to,” she answered gaily, though
her eyes filled with tears as she looked at the blue-veined
temples, and the dark circles under the blue
eyes so like her own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HAMLIN SPEAKS HIS MIND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One boy had been absent from section D that day.
This was David Hamlin, a big, handsome fellow, a
general favorite, and the acknowledged leader of the
better element in the class. He was at school early
the next morning, and listened with the greatest interest
to the story of the previous day’s happenings,
which the boys were eager to tell.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, looking from one to another when
the story was ended, “where were all you decent fellows
that you didn’t interfere? If I’d been here, I’d
have stood up for Clark. Coward indeed! He showed
pluck enough, I should say, in refusing to fight that
bully Crawford.”</p>

<p>But at this, a murmur of dissent went around the
group. It was plain that for once Hamlin was not
to have the popular support even of all his friends.</p>

<p>“No, no, Hamlin,” said one, “you can’t make me
believe that a fellow with the right sort of stuff in
him would let anybody give him the lie direct and a
blow in the face to boot, and not strike back. That’s
not my idea of courage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>“Nor mine. Nor mine,” cried half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>Hamlin looked from one to another, reading the
same opinion in every face.</p>

<p>“No,” he said scornfully. “It is quite evident
that it is <em>not</em> your idea of courage. Haven’t you
sense enough to see that Clark showed a courage as
much higher and finer than Crawford’s as his was
higher than that of&mdash;a mad bull, I was going to
say”; he stopped and half laughed, as he added,
“That’s a poor comparison however, for I don’t think
that Crawford’s courage <em>was</em> one whit higher or better
than a mad bull’s.”</p>

<p>Hamlin was standing with his back to the door.
A little stir, and a change in some of the faces
turned towards the door, made him glance around
to find Crawford himself standing just behind him
with a scowl on his dark face.</p>

<p>“So,” he said, “I seem to be the interesting subject
under discussion. Go on, go on. Pray don’t let
me interrupt you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to”; and as he spoke, Hamlin
wheeled quickly around so as to face the other.
“I’d just as soon, and in fact a little sooner, speak
my mind to your face. Crawford, if I’ve heard the
story straight, you did some mean, contemptible, cowardly
things, yesterday. <em>I</em> think such doings are a
disgrace to our section, and I tell you now once for
all, that if this sort of thing can’t be stopped I shall<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
ask for a transfer to some other section, and I shall
tell Professor Keene just why I want a transfer, too.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence while Crawford,
choking down his rage, looked from face to face to
see on which side were the sympathies of the boys.
Had any other than Hamlin said all this, Crawford
would have either laughed it to scorn or answered
by a sneer and a blow, but Hamlin was too popular
and stood too high in the class to be treated in that
way. He belonged, too, to a wealthy and influential
family, and these facts weighed heavily with Crawford;
so, though his eyes were full of sullen anger,
he only said gruffly, “Seems to me you’re making a
mountain out of a molehill. I gave that cad of a
Clark a slap across the mouth which he was too cowardly
to return. That’s all there is about it, and I
don’t see, for my part, why <em>you</em> are taking it up, and
making such a row over it, Hamlin.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know Clark very well,” replied Hamlin,
“but I’ve never seen anything sneaky or cowardly
about him, and I don’t believe he is either. I know
a fellow always gets the name of a coward if he
won’t pitch in and strike back like a prize fighter
when anybody insults him; but I’m beginning to
think that the <em>honor</em> that can only be proven by
making a brute of one’s self, isn’t worth very much
anyhow. But that blow of yours that Clark had the
<em>courage</em> not to return, Crawford, was only one of the<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
things that you were responsible for, yesterday, if all
I’ve heard is true. You all know,” he went on, turning
to the boys, “how often little Freeman is sick,
and how much he is absent on that account. Perhaps
some of you don’t know that he has no father,
and that his mother is working a good deal harder
than any woman ought to work, to keep him in
school. Freeman himself is very anxious to get to
work and help his mother, and the position he gets
after he graduates will depend largely on his school
record; yet you, Crawford, deliberately tried yesterday,
to make him fail, when he knew his lesson perfectly,
and not satisfied with that, you pitched into
him after school and rolled him in mud and water
in the street. It was a shame, Crawford&mdash;a little
delicate chap like him, not half your size! I can’t
see, for my part, how any decent fellow <em>could</em> have
stood by and seen it done without interfering”; and
Hamlin’s eyes blazed with righteous indignation as
he looked around the circle.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Hamlin, you’re putting it on too
thick,” said Crawford; “I”&mdash;but whispers of “Here
comes Bobby!” cut short the talk, and the boys
slipped into their seats as Mr. Horton entered the
class-room.</p>

<p>“Bobby” was the class name for the teacher of
section D.</p>

<p>Clark did not appear until the last moment&mdash;just<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
in time to avoid the tardy mark. His face was very
grave, and he looked neither to right nor left as he
took his seat, so he did not see Hamlin watching
eagerly for a chance to give him a friendly smile, and
Hamlin had to content himself with the thought,
“I’ll have a talk with him at recess.”</p>

<p>But at recess the principal, Prof. Keene, sent for
him and kept him so long in his office that the recess
was over before he was at liberty, and half an
hour before school was dismissed Clark, after a word
with Mr. Horton, left the room and did not return.</p>

<p>So Hamlin, breaking away from half a dozen boys
who surrounded him when school was out, hurried
after Freeman who was walking off alone.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Clark? Why did he leave
so early?” he asked, as he overtook the little fellow.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Freeman; then he added,
speaking earnestly and quickly, “You don’t believe
that it was because he was afraid that he didn’t fight
Crawford, do you, Hamlin?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” was the quick reply. “I don’t
believe in fighting any more than Clark does, though
I doubt if I should have had the moral courage to
do as he did and risk being called a coward.”</p>

<p>“I’m to blame for it all. It was his standing up
for me in class that began it,” said Freeman, with a
troubled face.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry over that,” said Hamlin kindly.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
“I’ll stand by him, and I know some of the other
fellows will too.”</p>

<p>“If you do, he won’t care much about the rest, I
guess,” said Freeman, who, like most of the younger
boys, looked up to David Hamlin as a model. He
turned off presently at his own corner, and Hamlin
walked on alone, saying to himself, “I’ll run around
and see Clark after supper.”</p>

<p>But his kindly purpose was not destined to be
carried out. When he reached home he was met
by his little brother with the announcement,
“Papa’s going to London to-morrow, and you’re
going with him.”</p>

<p>It was even so. Unexpected business made it
necessary for Mr. Hamlin to leave at this short
notice, and it had been decided that David should
go with him, and so his seat in section D was
vacant the next day, and for many days after.</p>

<p>Stanley Clark was the first boy in the school-room
the next morning, and he waited impatiently
for the teacher’s appearance, as he wanted to speak
to him alone; but Mr. Horton was later than usual,
and several boys were in the room when he came in.
Henderson’s seat was on the front row, and he
strained his ears to hear what Clark was saying, but
he only caught Mr. Horton’s reply, “You are sure
that there is no mistake about this, Clark?” and
then, “Very well, I will attend to it later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>Clark took his seat, and the morning recitations
went on as usual till just before the closing hour,
when Mr. Horton ordered books put away and the
attention of the class given to him. The order was
quickly obeyed and all eyes turned toward him,
while a most unusual silence reigned.</p>

<p>“It has come to my knowledge,” began Mr.
Horton, “that some very mean and contemptible
methods have been employed in this class to prevent
scholars who are really anxious to do well
from making perfect recitations. If anything of
this sort is done hereafter, I shall give the offenders
the severest possible punishment. The disorderly
element in this section shall be put down or put out
of the school. In the matter of scholarship I have
no fault to find with you as a class, but you are fast
getting the reputation of being the roughest and
most disorderly section in the school. Surely there
are some among you who are, to say the least, too
gentlemanly to be willing to have your section so
distinguished, and I call upon all such to see to it,
that you use all your influence in behalf of law and
order, and do your utmost to secure a different
reputation for section D.”</p>

<p>Many and various were the opinions expressed,
as, school being dismissed, the boys talked over the
matter so forcibly presented to them. Crawford’s
face was dark with anger as he walked on discussing<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
with his “crowd” the teacher’s severe
remarks.</p>

<p>“I believe that sneaking Clark’s at the bottom of
it,” he was saying angrily; “he was hobnobbing
with Horton before school, and I’ll bet a cooky he
put Bobby up to it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” added Henderson. “I heard
Bobby say, ‘You’re sure there’s no mistake about
this, Clark?’ and then thank him for the information
he had given.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, fellows?” cried Crawford.
“That’s the sort of chap Clark is. Couldn’t lower
himself to fight, but he can lower himself to tattle
to Bobby.”</p>

<p>“But, Crawford, it might have been something
else he was talking about. We don’t <em>know</em> that he
was tattling,” said a boy named Graham.</p>

<p>“Know,” repeated Crawford impatiently. “As if
there was any question about it. I don’t believe
there’s another fellow in the room who would tell
tales, and I move that we nip this thing in the bud,
and put down blabbing and tattling once for all.”</p>

<p>“So say I,” shouted Henderson, while Graham
cautiously inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>How</em> do you propose to put them down, Crawford?”</p>

<p>“Make it so hot for the tattlers that they’ll get
good and sick of it,” replied Crawford savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“But how&mdash;tell us how.”</p>

<p>Crawford looked from one to another of the
group.</p>

<p>“Henderson, you and Coyle and Green come
around to my rooms this evening, and we’ll fix this
thing up,” he said, pointedly ignoring Graham, and
two or three who had kept silence.</p>

<p>“Wonder what Crawford is up to now,” said one
of these boys whom Crawford had not named, dropping
back a step or two.</p>

<p>“Some scurvy trick, or other,” replied a second.
“For my part, I’m sick of him and his crowd. I
believe I’ll side with law and order after this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know but I’d better, too,” replied the first.
“I’ve half a mind to, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said the other quickly. “Let’s start in
to-morrow and see how many will join us.”</p>

<p>“Pity Hamlin’s away. He’s a power when he
takes hold of anything,” put in Raleigh, the third
boy.</p>

<p>“So he is,” said Graham, “and I wish he was
here too. The only trouble with Hamlin is that he’s
so full of fun that he gets to cutting up before
he stops to think&mdash;but he never does a mean
thing.”</p>

<p>“No, there’s nothing sneaky about Hamlin,” said
Raleigh, as he turned off towards his home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SECTION D TAKEN BY SURPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If a bomb had exploded in the room, the pupils
in section D could hardly have been more astounded
than they were a few days later, when, after the
opening exercises, Mr. Horton quietly remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Every boy that owns a key to the algebra we
use will please rise in his seat.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, then Freeman and
two other boys arose.</p>

<p>“Freeman,” said the teacher, “how do you use
the key?”</p>

<p>“I do the examples first, and then see if I have
the correct answers. If I have not, I keep trying
till I get them,” said Freeman frankly, but with a
very red face.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Horton. “You may be
seated, boys. Now, I want every other boy in the
room who uses a key, whether it belongs to him or
not, to rise.”</p>

<p>Nearly half the school stood then, and Mr. Horton’s
keen eyes noted the glances cast at some who
did not rise, and read their meaning clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“That will do,” he said. Then he looked about
the room slowly and searchingly.</p>

<p>“Clark,” he said, “you never use a key?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>“And you, Crawford?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Crawford promptly.</p>

<p>The boys did not realize how much the teacher
could read in their faces. He read something in
several faces as Crawford gave his positive denial,
and he thought to himself once more, “Crawford
will bear watching.” Then aloud he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am sorry to find that so many have been using
keys; but with those of you who have frankly and
honorably acknowledged it, I have no fault to find,
since I have never forbidden the use of them. I do
forbid it now, however, and I wish every key that
any of you have here or at home, handed to me to-morrow
morning. If I find any boy making use of
one hereafter, I shall not let him off easily. Now
take up your work.”</p>

<p>At recess D section gave attention to nothing but
the matter of the keys. Those who had risen at
Mr. Horton’s request were inclined to look with
scorn and contempt upon those who had used the
keys, but had not seen fit to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>“I say, Crawford, you certainly were cheeky!
You’ve used my key more than I have myself, and
you had the bluff to deny it,” said Barber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>Crawford yawned with pretended indifference,
then answered coolly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Twas none of Bobby’s business what I <em>had</em> done.
He said himself that he’d never forbidden it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Barber, and turning, walked off
to the other side of the playground.</p>

<p>Crawford had the grace to color a little at this,
but he turned to Henderson and shrugged his
shoulders as he said, “Huffy&mdash;’cause I’ve borrowed
his key. He’ll get over it. But now see here&mdash;the
thing I want to know is, who put Bobby up to
this dodge?”</p>

<p>“Of course ’twasn’t any of the fellows that use
the keys,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>“Right you are!” exclaimed Crawford, emphatically.
“It was some sneakin’ saint who never
stains his holy fingers with such polluted literature
as algebra keys, and I don’t know anybody so likely
to have done it as Clark.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” cried one, “I don’t believe it was
Clark.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, hey! Well I do, then. It takes a
coward to do a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“You always blame everything on Clark,” cried
Freeman, “and I think it’s mean of you, Crawford.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> think,” repeated Crawford, scornfully, then
turning to the others, he went on, “Who knows
anything about Clark, anyhow? He only entered<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
the school this year. Does anybody know where
he came from?”</p>

<p>“I believe he only came to the city just before
school opened. Isn’t that so, Freeman?” said one.</p>

<p>Freeman colored, and looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where’d he live before?” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“In&mdash;in Albany,” stammered Freeman, flushing
uneasily.</p>

<p>Crawford looked at him sharply, then turned again
to the others.</p>

<p>“I believe it was Clark,” he repeated, “and it just
makes one more thing we’ve got to pay him off for.
We’ve grounds enough now, Green, for doing what
we were talking over the other night.”</p>

<p>Green hesitated, then said slowly, “I think we
ought to have some proof that Clark is to blame for
this, first.”</p>

<p>Crawford’s face darkened. He leaned over and
whispered something in Green’s ear&mdash;something
unpleasant evidently, for Green shrank, and said
hastily, “Oh, well, if you’re so sure he did it, I’ll
back you up, of course. If he did it, he deserves all
he’ll get.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>if</em> he did it. We know well enough he did
it,” cried Crawford, “and if the rest of you will let
it pass, <em>I</em> won’t.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do about it?” asked another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll send Clark to Coventry for one thing. If
I see any fellow chumming with St. Clark after this,
I shall know what to think of him&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>One or two spoke a word in Clark’s behalf, but
he had been so little while among them, and was so
grave and reserved that he had made no friends.
Hamlin had been strongly attracted to him, but
Hamlin was so bright and popular that he was
always surrounded by a throng of boys, and had
seldom had the opportunity to see much of Clark.
Freeman’s mother and Clark’s mother were cousins,
but the boys, having until recently lived in different
cities, had seldom met until Clark entered the
school.</p>

<p>Now, the majority of the boys believed that Clark
had shown the white feather in refusing to fight
Crawford, and cowardice is one of the hardest things
to forget or forgive.</p>

<p>Hard days followed for Stanley Clark. The belief
quickly gained ground that he had informed Mr.
Horton that keys were used in the class, and this
added to the cloud already resting upon him. Soon,
not a boy in the section spoke to him or noticed him
except Freeman. Proud and sensitive, Clark felt
this keenly, and withdrew more and more into himself.
He would have remained in the school at
recess, but this was forbidden, so he was obliged to
go out. He never stayed in the playground, however,<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
but spent the twenty minutes walking up and
down the sidewalk in front of the school. At first,
Freeman used to join him there, but after a little
Clark sent him away. Freeman was hurt and
grieved at this, never guessing that his cousin was
too generous to let him fall under the shadow that
rested on himself.</p>

<p>So Freeman went more and more with the other
boys as the days and weeks went by.</p>

<p>One day he was on his way home when Crawford
overtook him, and to his great surprise, instead of
passing him with a rough word or a sneer as usual,
fell into step and walked on with him.</p>

<p>“I say, Freeman,” he began, “I’ve been wanting to
say a word to you. I used you rather roughly a
while ago.”</p>

<p>“’Deed you did,” said Freeman coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I acknowledge it, and I’m sorry for it. A
fellow can’t say any more than that&mdash;can he?”</p>

<p>Freeman looked up in great surprise, half suspecting
that Crawford was trying to make game of him;
but the big fellow was looking down at him in a
friendly fashion, and now held out his hand saying,
“Shake hands on it, boy, and let bygones be bygones,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you really mean it,” said Freeman,
hesitatingly giving his hand.</p>

<p>“To be sure I mean it, and to prove that I do, I’ll<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
take you for a drive to-morrow&mdash;if you’ll go. I’ve
a jolly pair of ponies. What time can you go?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;any time, as to-morrow’s Saturday,” said
Freeman, still doubting, unable to understand this
sudden change of manner.</p>

<p>He thought of it again and again that evening,
and finally talked it over with Edith.</p>

<p>“It’s the queerest thing,” he said; “I don’t yet believe
that he really meant it. Don’t believe he’ll
come for me at all, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t,” said Edith quickly; “I don’t
want you to be friends with such a fellow.”</p>

<p>“Not much danger of that,” Ray answered, “but
it’s better to have him for a friend than for an
enemy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I doubt that, Ray. You know what mother
says, ‘You can’t handle pitch without getting sticky
fingers.’ From what I’ve gathered, Crawford is
pitch of a pretty bad sort.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ray discontentedly, “I don’t see
what I can do except go with him to-morrow. It
isn’t likely he’ll ever ask me again, and if he does
I needn’t go; but after I’ve accepted his invitation,
he’d be mad if I didn’t go this time.”</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;es, I suppose so,” said Edith doubtfully;
“but I just can’t bear the thought of your being
with such a fellow even for one drive, Ray.”
Crawford appeared promptly the next day at the<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
hour appointed, and though his talk with Edith had
made Freeman uncomfortable, yet he could not
repress a thrill of very real pleasure, as the horses
bore the light carriage so swiftly through the wide,
smooth streets. Crawford exerted himself to be
entertaining, and he could be <em>very</em> entertaining when
he chose, and before the drive was over, Freeman
wondered how he could ever have considered his
companion ugly and disagreeable.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a jolly good time, Crawford,” he said
heartily, as the carriage stopped again at his own
door. “Thank you ever so much for taking me
along.”</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve enjoyed it,” replied Crawford.
“We’ll repeat it some day soon.”</p>

<p>As he drove off, he chuckled and said to himself,
“Little fool! ’Twill be easy enough to get hold of
him. And the innocent way the baby told me about
St. Clark. Oh my! If it wasn’t rich!”</p>

<p>He drove around for Henderson, and told him
what he had wormed out of the unconscious Freeman,
and the two put their heads together and
planned that which was to bring shame and deep
sorrow upon Clark.</p>

<p>As to Freeman, he was so loud in his praises
of Crawford and his kindness, that Edith began
to wonder if she could have misjudged him, and to
think that it might have been merely thoughtlessness<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
and boyish roughness after all, instead of
meanness and cruelty, as she had thought, that had
made him treat her brother so.</p>

<p>Freeman looked at Crawford doubtfully when he
saw him at school on Monday. Even yet, he could
not feel quite sure that his new friendliness would
be lasting, but Crawford called out a gay greeting
and summoned him to join the group about him,
and the others followed Crawford’s lead, wondering
somewhat at this sudden friendliness towards “little
Freeman,” but ready enough to take him in; and he,
flattered by Crawford’s notice, and always too ready
to follow, soon began to be counted in as one of
“Crawford’s crowd.”</p>

<p>One morning a week or two later, Crawford and
Henderson were the first to enter the class-room.
After a hasty glance around, Crawford exclaimed,
“You stay here at the door, Henderson, to see that
nobody comes.”</p>

<p>Whatever Crawford had to do was quickly
accomplished, and he and Henderson were lounging
in the hall, when the other boys began to come in,
and all went into D class-room together, where,
perched on desks and backs of chairs, they dropped
into lively conversation.</p>

<p>“Come on up here, Hendy. What are you sitting
off there for?” called Crawford, for Henderson had
taken the seat nearest the door, where he could see
any one approaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“I’m waiting for Coyle,” he replied, without turning
his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, Coyle’s always half an hour behind time.
He’ll be late at his own funeral if he don’t look
out,” cried Green.</p>

<p>“Say, Green&mdash;got your examples done?” asked
Crawford, glancing at the clock and keeping an eye
on Henderson.</p>

<p>“No, plague it! Bobby gave us a double dose
yesterday, an’ it takes such a time to prove ’em all.”</p>

<p>“If we only had the keys now, ’twouldn’t take
half so long,” grumbled Barber.</p>

<p>At this moment Henderson coughed, and Crawford,
whose back was towards the door, called out
loudly, “Well, I say it’s no fair to take away algebra
keys and let the Latin class keep their ponies.
Clark and some others wouldn’t get the marks they
do if Bobby should make a raid on their ponies.”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh-sh” went around the group, and Henderson
strolled carelessly back to his own seat as Mr.
Horton entered the room.</p>

<p>The other boys looked inquiringly at the teacher,
wondering how much he had overheard, but they
could gather nothing from his face. They were not
left long in doubt, however, for, as soon as the
opening exercises were over, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When, a short time ago, I called for all the
algebra keys, I supposed that I had put an end<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
to the use of helps of that sort, but from a remark
that I overheard as I entered the school-room this
morning, I am obliged to believe that I have been
mistaken. I will give you the same opportunity
that I gave on the previous occasion, and ask every
boy who has, or who uses, any translation or other
such help in preparing his Latin to rise.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Horton ceased speaking, one boy rose.
There was a ripple of laughter, for this boy&mdash;Vale&mdash;was
the dullard of the class, but the teacher’s stern
voice quickly checked the merriment.</p>

<p>“You may be seated, Vale,” he said. “And now
I wish all the members of the Latin class, except
Vale, to come forward.”</p>

<p>His order being obeyed, he left his seat, and,
walking down the aisles, looked into the desks
of all except Vale. Four faces were full of dismay
as he passed from desk to desk, but only one was
turned toward him in blank surprise as he returned
to his seat with five books in his hands.</p>

<p>“Barber, Green, Hopkins, Cox and Clark, remain
where you are. The others may return to their
seats,” he said.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the five boys before him with
mingled sorrow and sternness.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “I am terribly disappointed
in you. It is bad enough to find that you have
been resorting to such methods to avoid work and<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
secure high marks, but you have added to your
guilt by deliberately lying about it. I had thought
better of you than this.”</p>

<p>As he paused, Clark, whose face had shown strong
emotion, stepped forward and said: “Mr. Horton,
did you find one of those books in my desk?”</p>

<p>There was a touch of contempt in the teacher’s
voice as he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I did, sir, and I hope you will not lower yourself
further by useless protestations.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Horton,” said the boy very quietly, “I
should be doing wrong if I did not declare that
I have never used any help in preparing my Latin
except the notes in the book itself. I never saw the
book you have there, and do not know how it came
in my desk.”</p>

<p>Somebody hissed then, but Mr. Horton promptly
checked the demonstration.</p>

<p>“You can hardly expect me to believe you, Clark,
with the evidence I have here,” he said, pointing to
the fly-leaf of the book, on which were the letters
“S. C.” Part of the leaf was torn out, leaving only
those two letters.</p>

<p>The look of bewildered surprise in Clark’s eyes
turned to one of proud disdain as he saw those
letters, and he did not open his lips again, not even
when Mr. Horton said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall give every one of you five a failure for<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
each Latin recitation during the past week, and for
the remainder of the month I wish each of you to
write at the top of your Latin exercises these
words.” He wrote rapidly on the blackboard:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lying lips are an abomination.”</p>

<p>The other four went to their seats with red faces
and shamed eyes, but Clark’s face was very white,
and his eyes were proudly uplifted, as if he dared
his schoolmates to believe him guilty, in spite of the
evidence against him.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t act guilty,” thought Mr. Horton
uneasily, as he looked at the boy. “I wonder if it
is possible that he is innocent.”</p>

<p>“St. Clark won’t be in good odor for a while to
come,” chuckled Henderson on the playground at
recess, glancing with malicious eyes at the lonely
boy pacing up and down the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he used that pony, anyhow,” said
Freeman. “He didn’t need to use it, for he had
read Cicero long before he ever came here. It’s just
review to him.”</p>

<p>“Hush up, you!” exclaimed Henderson hastily.
“If it’s review to him, he’s no business to be
marked higher than the rest of us who never took
it before. Hold your tongue, youngster, if you
know when you’re well off.” He whispered the last
sentence in Freeman’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, keep quiet, boy,” said Crawford; and<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
in a lower tone he added, “Don’t you fret. He’ll
come out all right enough.”</p>

<p>But in his heart Crawford was thinking, “He
won’t come out all right if I can prevent it, and
I think I can.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A BLOW FOR CLARK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Mr. Horton, can we have the use of this room
for an hour or so after school to-day?”</p>

<p>It was Gordon who asked the question.</p>

<p>“We including&mdash;?” said Mr. Horton, inquiringly.</p>

<p>“All the section, I hope,” answered Gordon.
“Some of us, Mr. Horton, have made up our minds
that there has got to be a change in D section. We
don’t like the reputation that we are getting.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear you say so, Gordon,” said
Mr. Horton earnestly. “I feel deeply ashamed of it
myself, and have been giving most serious thought
to the matter for some time past. But if you boys
will set yourselves to work in real earnest, you can
accomplish far more than is possible for me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir, how much we shall be able to
accomplish,” said Gordon, “but some of us are bound
to try. The trouble is, that there are in our section
so many that don’t care anything about their standing
either in their studies or in deportment. All
they seem to think about is having a good time.
We’ve been talking the matter over, Graham, Sherman<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
and I, and we’re afraid that we can’t get a majority
to act with us.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will find yourselves mistaken about
that,” said Mr. Horton, “and that more than half
the class will be ready to join you at once. Certainly,
you can use this room; but, of course, you
must be very quiet and orderly in your discussions.”

“We’ll do our best, sir,” said Gordon, as he turned
away and began to distribute slips of paper, laying
one on each desk.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton picked one up. It read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are requested to attend a class meeting in
this room at 2.15 this afternoon, for the discussion
of matters of great importance to every member of
the class.</p>

<div class="ir1" style="margin-top:-1em"><p class="displayinline">“Fred Gordon.<br />
Alec. Graham.<br />
Ralph Sherman.“</p></div></div>

<p>These notices awakened the liveliest interest and
curiosity, and not one boy left the room when school
was over, while Mr. Horton departed promptly that
there might be no delay in the business of the hour.
The door had barely closed behind him when the
room was in an uproar, many voices calling upon
Gordon, Graham and Sherman to know what was
up.</p>

<p>Gordon, having tried in vain to make himself
heard amid the din, seized a ruler and rapped on his<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
desk, and having thus gained attention for a second,
he sprang up on his seat and began rapidly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you’ll just keep quiet a minute or so, I’ll tell
you why this meeting was called. You all know
that section D does not bear a very high reputation,
but perhaps you don’t all know what a <em>very</em> bad
name we have gained, not only in the school, but
outside of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” called out Henderson; but Green said,
“Hush up, Hendy. Let’s hear what the good little
boy’s got to say. We can sit down on him easy
enough after he gets through preaching.”</p>

<p>Gordon went on, “I heard a gentleman&mdash;one of
the prominent business men in town&mdash;say the other
day, that ‘such a set of young toughs as seemed to
be collected in section D would be a disgrace to any
school,’ and a lady that my mother knows, refused to
allow a boy belonging to this section to be introduced
to her daughters. Now <em>I</em> think that we’ve all reason
to be ashamed of our record when people talk that
way about us, and what is more, the school board
has taken the matter up, and is determined to have
a change here. So you see we’ve <em>got</em> to behave ourselves
anyhow, and so why not take matters into our
own hands and do it of our own accord without waiting
till we’re forced into it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! I’d like to see anybody <em>force me</em> to
do anything I don’t want to do,” said Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“Or me, either,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>“Oh, well&mdash;if you <em>want</em> to be suspended or dismissed
from the school for good, I’ve no doubt that
can soon and easily be brought about,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“They ain’t agoin’ to suspend fifteen or twenty
boys, an’ don’t you believe it,” said Coyle.</p>

<p>“’Specially when those fifteen or twenty belong to
the brightest section in the school,” added another
boy.</p>

<p>“Small thanks to you for that,” retorted Graham,
at which there was a general laugh, the speaker being
by no means a brilliant scholar.</p>

<p>He joined in the laugh, saying lazily, “Oh well,
the rest of you do poling enough without me.”</p>

<p>“But we’re losing ground even in scholarship,” put
in Sherman, “another section beat us last quarter,
and a girl’s section at that.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, we don’t grudge the pretty dears a few
marks,” supplementing his remarks with a coarse
laugh, and a word or two that made more than one
boy’s cheeks burn.</p>

<p>“There, fellows!” cried Gordon, turning to a group
near him, “<em>that’s</em> the kind of thing that has brought
our section down so low. It isn’t just fun, or even
carelessness and disorder. It is low, filthy talk, and
the oaths that some of us use so constantly, that
make everybody so down on us, and I don’t wonder
at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>“Pretty little boy! Does his mammy know he’s
out?” said Henderson, tauntingly.</p>

<p>“’Course she does. He’s still tied to her apron-string,”
put in Coyle.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think such talk is very smart,”
said Gordon, trying hard to look undisturbed,
“but I think we are all old enough to begin to act
like gentlemen, to say the least, and some of us
mean to show that we <em>are</em> gentlemen. We are going
to form a law and order society, and elect a president
and secretary, and see what we can do to make our
section one to be proud of.”</p>

<p>“Suppose one of our crowd should get the most
votes for president,” queried Crawford, “what then?”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing one of your crowd should
be president, provided he will pledge himself to forward
the objects of the society,” said Gordon, as he
pulled a book from his desk, and opening it, added,
“A few of us who feel pretty deeply on this subject
have drawn up a rough pledge which every member
joining our association must sign&mdash;and keep.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Deacon, read it out,” called Henderson.</p>

<p>“Yes, stand up like a little man and read right
out,” added Crawford; and Gordon read:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We, the undersigned deeply regretting that our
section has gained such an undesirable reputation,
do pledge ourselves to do all in our power to maintain<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
order in school hours, and to raise the standard of
scholarship, of conduct and of conversation in section
D.”</p>

<p>To this ten names were affixed&mdash;including Gordon,
Graham and Sherman.</p>

<p>“You must think we are all fools if you believe
we’re going to tie ourselves up like that,” shouted
Henderson with his coarse laugh as Gordon finished
reading.</p>

<p>“A fellow wants a little fun even in school,” said
another.</p>

<p>“Might as well join the church, an’ done with it,
as to sign that thing,” said Green.</p>

<p>“Boys,” cried Gordon, trying to make himself
heard above the clamor of voices, “I know there are
some, whose names are not here, who will join us.
Please come on and sign now&mdash;all who will&mdash;and
then we’ll withdraw to some place where we can
talk this thing over quietly.”</p>

<p>Six other boys signed their names amid taunts
and jeers from Crawford and his cronies.</p>

<p>“Now there are sixteen of us,” said Gordon, “and
as there are forty in the section, we lack four of
half. I don’t believe that all the rest want to be
counted in as opposed to what we all know is right.”</p>

<p>Clark had listened silently to all that had been
said. He was heartily in sympathy with Gordon,
and wanted much to add his name, but he hesitated,<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
uncertain whether, even in such a case as this, he
would be welcome. But he could not endure to be
counted in with such fellows as Crawford and
Henderson, and so he rose and took the pen to sign
his name.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Crawford quickly, “St. Clark
among the law-givers, eh!”</p>

<p>Clark’s face flushed, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>Then Henderson shouted, “He’s a fine one to be
setting up for an example, he&mdash;the son of a thief
who’d be behind the bars this moment if he hadn’t
absconded with his pickings.”</p>

<p>Instantly every voice was hushed and every eye
turned on Clark. His face grew deadly white, and
the pen dropped from his fingers. He turned
towards Henderson and tried to speak, but no sound
came from his lips, and in another instant he had
turned and rushed from the room.</p>

<p>“Henderson, is that true?” demanded Gordon
sternly, as the door closed behind Clark.</p>

<p>For once, Henderson absolutely looked ashamed
of himself, and his manner was much less blustering
than usual, as he said sulkily, “Yes, ’tis. His
father is that Albany fellow who had to leave the
country because he had used trust-funds.”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Gordon, “I don’t care if it is
true, it was a contemptibly mean thing for you to
blurt it out like that before the whole class. How
would you like it if it was your father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>“My father is a gentleman,” said Henderson,
drawing himself up proudly.</p>

<p>“That’s more than can be said for his son,” muttered
Sherman with a glance of disgust at Henderson’s
coarse face; “I shouldn’t think Clark would
ever want to come into this school-room again.”</p>

<p>“Small loss if he didn’t. We don’t want sons of
convicts here,” said a hot-headed Georgian.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Lee,” said Gordon. “For my
part, I’m right down sorry for Clark. He can’t
help what his father has done, and isn’t to blame
for it, and yet he’s got to have it thrown up at him
all his life.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’s got some of the same blood in his
veins. They say if a fellow will lie he’ll steal too,
and Clark came mighty near lying over that Latin
business,” said a boy who had not before spoken.</p>

<p>“Don’t know about that,” quickly responded a
little fellow named Reed.</p>

<p>Crawford looked up hastily at that, but Reed was
not looking at him, and he said nothing.</p>

<p>Finally, three more boys signed their names, making
nineteen in all, and then Gordon courteously requested
those who were not willing to sign, to leave
the room, which, after some noise, and not a few
disagreeable remarks, they did. Then a vote was
taken which resulted in a large majority for Gordon
as president, Graham as vice-president, and Sherman
as secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a pity we haven’t two more, then we’d have
more than half the class,” said one, as they left the
room.</p>

<p>“Hamlin will be back next month; he’ll be on
our side,” said Graham.</p>

<p>“Hamlin? Why he’s the biggest monkey in the
class,” laughed another.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s full of jokes and monkey shines, I
know,” returned Graham, “but there isn’t a mean
streak in him, and you never knew him to deny it
if he had cut up any caper.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. He’s true blue every time” added
Gordon.</p>

<p>“There’s little Freeman&mdash;he was absent to-day.
Think he’ll sign?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“Doubtful,” said Gordon; “he’s getting pretty
thick with Crawford’s crowd lately&mdash;more’s the
pity. He used to be rather a nice little chap.”</p>

<p>“He and Clark are related, aren’t they?” questioned
one.</p>

<p>“I believe somebody said they were,” answered
Graham. “I did feel right down sorry for Clark to-day,”
he added.</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Sherman. “He looked as if he
had had an awful blow when he left the room.”</p>

<p>“I say&mdash;can’t we be a little more decent to
him?” suggested Gordon. “We’ve been sending him
to Coventry with a vengeance. I don’t believe a<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
fellow in the class ever speaks to him now, except
Freeman.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be hired to come to school if I were
cold-shouldered in such a fashion,” said Raleigh.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for that Latin business I’d stand by
Clark after this,” said Graham.</p>

<p>“I never could get over his taking that blow so
meekly from Crawford,” said another.</p>

<p>“Meekly!” echoed Gordon, “Were you there when
that thing happened?”</p>

<p>“No, some of the fellows told me about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they told you that Clark took that blow
meekly, they lied&mdash;that’s all! I was standing close
by, and I saw the whole thing. When Crawford
struck him, Clark’s eyes fairly blazed, and he grabbed
Crawford’s wrists, and I thought he was going to lay
him out sure. I know he could have done it, but he
just held himself in, and the next minute he flung
Crawford’s hands away from him and ran up the
stairs as if he did not dare to trust himself within
reach of that hound.”</p>

<p>“Meaning Crawford?” said a listener.</p>

<p>“Meaning Crawford. He and Henderson are not
fit to be among decent fellows, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>“That’s an entirely new version of the fracas between
Clark and Henderson,” said the one to whom
Gordon had spoken, “and puts another face on that
affair; but how about his informing about the<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
algebra keys? Henderson says he heard him talking
to Bobby about it.”</p>

<p>“Henderson!” repeated Gordon scornfully. “Don’t
quote Henderson to me! Such a foul-mouthed cad
as he is, is a disgrace to any school. I’ll admit that
I’ve never caught him in a lie, but all the same I
haven’t an atom of confidence in him, and I don’t
think Clark or anybody else ought to be condemned
on no stronger evidence than his word.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you’re right,” was the reply,
“but I doubt if Clark comes back at all. I wouldn’t
if I were in his place.”</p>

<p>But Clark did go back; to the surprise of many of
the boys he was in his seat as usual the next morning;
he might have been the only boy in the room,
however, for all the attention he paid to his classmates.</p>

<p>Several of them, feeling that he had been hardly
used, and not feeling at all sure that he deserved all
the blame that had fallen upon him, were inclined
to make advances, but he met them with a coldness
that repelled the most friendly, and after one or two
such rebuffs they left him again alone. Not one of
them could begin to understand the bitter agony of
his proud young soul, and the unspeakable mortification
he suffered continually through the father of
whom he had once been so proud.</p>

<p>The law and order society met regularly once a<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
week after this, and its influence soon began to be
felt, even though it worked against heavy odds, for
those who had not joined seemed determined to do
all in their power to lessen its influence and to
maintain the undesirable reputation that the section
had already acquired. On the other hand, the
members of the new society, realizing the fact that
so many were working against them, were impelled
to do their utmost for the improvement of their
class record. The result was that the nineteen
members soon showed a marked improvement in
scholarship, while their orderly and gentlemanly
deportment was in striking contrast to the rough,
turbulent behavior of the other half of the class.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HAMLIN RETURNS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, Hamlin, are you holding a reception? I’m
sure we are all very glad to see you back again,” said
Mr. Horton, as he entered the school-room one morning
and found Hamlin the center of a merry, noisy
group.</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder he’s a favorite. That smile of his
is enough to win anybody,” the teacher thought, as
from his seat at the desk he glanced again and again
at the constantly increasing group about Hamlin;
but at a stroke of the bell the group dissolved as if
by magic, and each boy dropped into his own seat.</p>

<p>At recess Hamlin was seized almost bodily and
hurried off to the playground. Clark had obtained
permission to stay in that day, and Mr. Horton
chanced to glance towards him just in time to note
the expression on his face as he looked after Hamlin
and the eager crowd that bore him away. As they
disappeared Clark sighed, and opening his book, began
to read.</p>

<p>A hand upon his shoulder made him start and<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
glance up in surprise. Mr. Horton was standing at
his side looking down at him.</p>

<p>“Clark,” he said, “I have come to the conclusion
that I wronged you when I doubted your explanation
about the translation I found in your desk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you did,” said Clark; “I told you the
truth.”</p>

<p>“I believe you did, Clark, and I ask your pardon
for doubting you,” said Mr. Horton, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>There was a lump in the boy’s throat and his eyes
were hot as he took the offered hand, but he did not
speak&mdash;he could not at that moment.</p>

<p>“I know no more about the matter, my boy, than
I did that day,” Mr. Horton went on, “but I have
been watching you ever since, and I believe that you
can be trusted.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Clark, the first smile that
his teacher had seen on his face for many a day
flitting across it as he spoke. It was gone in a
moment. It seemed as if his lips had almost forgotten
how to smile.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea how the book got into your
desk, Clark?”</p>

<p>“I have an idea, but it may be a mistaken one,
and I would rather say nothing about it,” Clark
replied in a low voice.</p>

<p>“You have not made many friends in the school,<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
have you?” asked Mr. Horton after a moment’s
silence.</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;none.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know why it was so at first, but
now&mdash;now I don’t wonder at it.” Clark spoke the
last words so low that his teacher had to bend
his head to catch them.</p>

<p>“I would like a talk with you, my boy. Can you
come to my house this evening?” he asked presently.</p>

<p>“I am not at liberty until nine o’clock,” Clark
answered.</p>

<p>“Not any evening?” said Mr. Horton in a tone of
surprise.</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;except Sunday. I take notes in shorthand
every evening from six to nine.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have very much time for study,
then?”</p>

<p>“No, not very much; but I don’t have to spend
very much time on the Latin, as I have read Cicero
before.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Then I see you did not need any
notes for it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I used to go to a private classical
school, and most of my time was given to languages
and history.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Well, you have had two study-hours<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
to-day; what lessons have you now to prepare for
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I’ve very little to do&mdash;just a bit of work in
English literature.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, can’t you walk home with me
after school?”</p>

<p>Clark assented, and the teacher returned to his
seat as the bell rang and the boys trooped noisily
up the stairs.</p>

<p>In the long talk that Mr. Horton had with Clark
that afternoon, he learned the bitter secret in regard
to his father&mdash;now, alas, a secret no longer&mdash;and
felt his heart go out to the lad who was bearing so
heavy a burden on his brave young shoulders.</p>

<p>“You would be sure to hear it after a while, Mr.
Horton,” Clark had said, “and I’d rather tell it to
you myself just as it is.”</p>

<p>“And that is why you and your mother came
here to live,” said the teacher, voice and eyes full of
sympathy he knew not how to speak.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. An old friend of mother’s got this
place for me. I’d learned stenography just because
I liked it, not expecting ever to use it to earn my
living.”</p>

<p>“And has your mother no means?” questioned
Mr. Horton gently.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he said. “She gave up every dollar of
her own private means, and if I live, every penny<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
that was lost thro’ my father shall be repaid, if
it takes me a lifetime to do it.”</p>

<p>“Clark,” said Mr. Horton, “I am proud of you.
No danger but you will succeed, only,” he laid his
hand kindly across the lad’s shoulders&mdash;“only you
must not allow yourself to grow morbid under it.
Remember you are responsible for no one’s wrong-doing
but your own. Keep that in mind, and don’t
let any chance reference or intentional fling embitter
you, or turn you against others. Remember that
they can judge only by what they see, and they see
but little of the truth.”</p>

<p>“It’s done me no end of good to talk with you,
Mr. Horton. It’s a great deal to me to feel that
you trust me,” and Clark’s voice would tremble
a little, as he added, “I shan’t feel so alone now.
You see I’ve had no one to talk to&mdash;for of course I
couldn’t let mother know how things went at
school. She has enough to bear without any
worries on my account.”</p>

<p>“There goes a young hero, if there ever was one,”
the teacher said to himself as he looked after the
tall lad going down the street a little later. “I
must try to find some way to make it pleasanter for
him at school. I’ll talk to Hamlin about it, the
first chance I get.”</p>

<p>It was not long before he made the opportunity,
and the few words he felt at liberty to say awakened<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
in David Hamlin a very strong interest in his
schoolmate.</p>

<p>Hamlin had already become a member of the law
and order society, though he grumblingly declared
that he thought it was a shame to make him promise
to give up all his fun.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Clark happened to be
a little later than usual in getting off to school, and
rushing out of his doorway, ran plump into a lad
who was standing in the vestibule.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said hastily, and would
have hurried on, but the other held out his hand,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, now, if that isn’t a friendly greeting for a
fellow that’s been standing here twenty minutes
waiting for you! Do you always come out of your
front door in such a boomerang style as that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Clark with a laugh, as he took Hamlin’s
offered hand. “I’m not often so late.”</p>

<p>The two walked on together, and in spite of
himself, Clark’s proud reserve melted under the
sunny friendliness of his companion. Hamlin
would not be held off. He persisted in talking as if
Clark was “in the swim” of school doings, just as
he himself was, and Clark did not know how to
undeceive him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see you at the L. A. O. meeting yesterday,”
he remarked as they walked on. L. A. O. was
short for law and order society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not a member,” said Clark, coldly.</p>

<p>“What! You, the most orderly fellow in the
section, not a member of that society!” exclaimed
Hamlin. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t want me,” said Clark.</p>

<p>“Didn’t want you? Oh, come, now, you can’t
make me believe that. Why, I thought every
fellow in the room was in the L. A. O. or the
Antis.”</p>

<p>“Anti? I hadn’t heard of that. Do you mean
that the Crawford crowd has organized an opposition
to the L. A. O.?” asked Clark.</p>

<p>“Just that; and I heard Henderson boasting that
they’d got half the class on their roll.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t my name,” said Clark.</p>

<p>“Of course I knew that,” said Hamlin, “but
they’ve got some fellows that I wouldn’t have
believed would join such a gang&mdash;little Freeman,
for instance. I always thought he was such a nice
little chap, and now he’s thick as thieves with
Crawford.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Clark, stopping short in
amazement, “Freeman thick with Crawford! Why,
I thought he couldn’t endure the fellow.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought, but Freeman’s ’round
with that crowd every recess, and I saw him out
driving with Crawford yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t an idea of it. That must be stopped,”<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
said Clark with a troubled face. “Crawford’s no
kind of a fellow for a little chap like Ray to be
with.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, there,” responded Hamlin. “I
wouldn’t have my little brother ’round with such a
fellow for a good deal.”</p>

<p>They had reached the school by this time, and
Hamlin had only time to say, “I shall propose your
name at the next meeting of the L. A. O. We need
your help against the Antis.”</p>

<p>The Antis were primed for mischief that day.
Before the opening exercises were over, Mr. Horton
knew that there was a hard day before him. The
spirit of rebellion was abroad in the air. His orders
were obeyed, but slowly and reluctantly, as if under
protest. There was a continual shuffling of feet,
knocking of books against desks, dropping of pencils,
and a buzzing and murmuring here, there, and
everywhere, impossible to locate, yet plainly distinguishable.
The L. A. O.’s were orderly and attentive,
every one, but the others did their utmost to keep
them from making perfect recitations by coughing,
laughing, and interrupting as much as they dared.
Finally, Mr. Horton sent Crawford to the board to
work out a problem. Crawford was very quick when
he chose to be. To-day he pretended to be uncertain
about his work and put down the figures very slowly.
Mr. Horton had taken his stand in the back of the<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
room, the better to watch the unruly ones. Unfortunately,
he was very short-sighted, and Crawford
took advantage of this fact. He had considerable
artistic ability, and could make a likeness with half
a dozen strokes, and he could use his right and left
hands with equal facility.</p>

<p>So, as with his left hand he slowly worked out
the problem, with his right he drew sketches of Mr.
Horton on the board, carefully keeping his own broad
shoulders between his work and the teacher. In one
sketch, Mr. Horton was represented with a pipe in
his mouth, in another with his hair à la Pompadour,
and again he had the tonsure of a monk, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton, standing at the back of the room,
tried in vain to discover what was causing so much
merriment. At last, suspecting that Crawford was
at the bottom of it, he suddenly called out, “Stand
aside, Crawford, and let me see your work.”</p>

<p>Crawford obeyed, but as he did so he swept the
eraser across his last artistic effort. He had to do
it so hurriedly, however, that enough remained to
show what had been there, and as the teacher returned
to the platform, he saw how Crawford had
been amusing himself and the class.</p>

<p>“Crawford,” he said, “you will have a failure for
this recitation.”</p>

<p>“I solved the problem you gave me correctly,”
said Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“I know you did,” said Mr. Horton.</p>

<p>“Well then,” persisted Crawford, “I don’t see why
I should have a failure.”</p>

<p>“If you have anything more to say you can come
to me after school,” said Mr. Horton.</p>

<p>“I call that right down mean,” said Crawford, in
a tone that all about him could hear, “and I won’t
stand much more such treatment.”</p>

<p>“Crawford, you may go to Professor Keene’s office,”
said Mr. Horton, gravely.</p>

<p>Muttering something half aloud, Crawford arose
and swaggered across the room, turning at the door
to make an elaborate bow, first to Mr. Horton and
then to the class. He did not go to the office, however,
but straight to his rooms, where he ordered his
ponies brought around, and then driving back to the
school, sent in a note to Henderson.</p>

<p>Henderson read it, and then passing it to Coyle,
he went to the desk and said, “Mr. Horton, I’ve just
had word that my father has been taken suddenly
ill. Can I be excused?”</p>

<p>Mr. Horton looked at him sharply, but Henderson’s
face was grave and troubled, and after a moment’s
hesitation, he said, “Yes, you may go.”</p>

<p>He did not see the wink and grimace with which
Henderson favored his classmates as he turned away
and left the room.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, he was seated beside Crawford,<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
and the horses were bearing them swiftly along, while
they chuckled over the neat way in which they had
“done old Bobby.”</p>

<p>“Now the ringleaders are out of the way, I hope
there will be no more disturbance to-day,” thought
the teacher; but his hope was not destined to be
realized.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind Henderson, somebody
snapped a marble up to the ceiling. As it dropped,
it struck Raleigh’s glasses. He started up with the
blood streaming from his face where a sliver of glass
had cut it.</p>

<p>“Who threw that marble?” said Mr. Horton in a
tone that none of them had ever heard from his lips
before. Then, as no one answered, he stepped quickly
to Raleigh’s side. “Did any of the glass go in your
eyes?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I think not,” answered Raleigh, putting
his handkerchief up to his cheek, which was bleeding
quite freely.</p>

<p>“Come with me to the dressing-room, Raleigh, and
Hamlin, you may take charge of the room until I return,”
said Mr. Horton, still in that stern tone that
boded ill for the one who had caused the trouble.</p>

<p>The room was very quiet while Mr. Horton was
absent. When he returned, having sent Raleigh
home, he said slowly, “I call upon the boy who
threw the marble that injured Raleigh to stand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>He waited, amid a silence that could almost be
felt, but no one moved.</p>

<p>“I understand, of course, that whoever did it, had
no intention of injuring anyone. It was simply a
piece of the thoughtlessness and lawlessness that
prevail in this section, but I intend to find out who
is to blame in this instance. Once more&mdash;I ask the
boy who threw that marble to rise.”</p>

<p>Still no one moved, and the stern look deepened
in the teacher’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that he has not manliness enough
to acknowledge frankly what he has done. There
are some boys in the class that I <em>know</em> are above
suspicion. With the exception of these, I shall ask
each one separately.</p>

<p>“Green, did you throw that marble?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Green.</p>

<p>“Do you know who threw it?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>From seat to seat Mr. Horton passed, asking
these two questions of each boy. In every case the
answer was the same. Hamlin, Graham, Clark,
Gordon and Raleigh were among the boys of whom
the questions were not asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton returned to his seat, and the boys
waited breathlessly for what should follow. Without
another word he dismissed the class, asking the
members of the L. A. O. to remain. He looked surprised<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
as Clark passed out with the Antis, and said
to Graham, “Isn’t Clark a member of your society?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” Graham answered; and Hamlin added
quickly, “I want him to join, and I’m almost sure
he wants to. There’s not a fellow in the class that
keeps the rules as he does.”</p>

<p>“None better, I am sure,” said Mr. Horton; then
he added, “I want to say to you that I have noticed
with much pleasure a very decided improvement in
the class since your society was formed. I believe
that every one of you is doing his best in respect to
studies, and in trying to raise the general standard
of the class. This has been a very trying day to
me, but if, as I hope, Raleigh’s eyes have escaped
injury, this affair may, in the end, prove a blessing in
disguise, for I am sure that some of the lawless ones
have been pretty thoroughly frightened, and perhaps
you can persuade some of them to join with you
after this. I hope so, I am sure. When I discover
the boy who threw that marble to-day, I shall make
an example of him. If he had confessed, I would
not have been hard on him, but he has aggravated
his fault by lying about it, and a lie is, to me, next
to unpardonable. It is one of the hardest things for
me to overlook. I have hope of a boy if he is truthful,
even though he has a host of other faults. Now,
boys, if I can help you in any way about your association,<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
I shall be most glad to do so. My hope for
section D is in you.”</p>

<p>“Bobby’s first-class. I like him,” said Hamlin, as
the boys walked homeward together.</p>

<p>“So he is,” said Gordon, “but I tell you what,
boys, the L. A. O.’s have a big contract on their
hands.”</p>

<p>“To put down the Crawford gang, you mean?”
said Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe they grow worse and worse.”</p>

<p>“So they do,” assented Graham. “Have you any
idea who threw that marble?”</p>

<p>“It was somebody down in Freeman’s neighborhood,”
said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Likely as not ’twas Freeman himself. He’s getting
to be as bad as any of ’em,” remarked another.</p>

<p>“Pity, too&mdash;I hate to see a fellow change as he
has,” said Hamlin. “Why not try to get him into
the L. A. O.?”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe you can do it. He’s awfully set
up because Crawford makes so much of him now. I
see them out driving together often,” said Sherman.</p>

<p>“Queer, too&mdash;shouldn’t think a fellow like Crawford
would want a little chap ’round with him so
much,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t think Freeman’s folks would like it,
if they know of it,” said another.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I turn off here. Don’t forget the<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
meeting of the L. A. O. to-morrow. Something’s got
to be done,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“And the question is&mdash;what?” added Hamlin.</p>

<p>And that question was often in the minds of
them all through the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">UNPLEASANT FOR CRAWFORD AND HENDERSON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Crawford’s mother had died before he was five
years old. His father outlived her but a few
months, and by the father’s will his lawyer, who
was also an old friend, was appointed guardian to
the child and trustee of the large property to which
the boy was heir.</p>

<p>This lawyer, Mr. Chase, was a scrupulously honorable
man, but he was a very busy one, and, being
a bachelor, knew little about the bringing up of a
boy.</p>

<p>At six, Crawford was sent to boarding-school.
His bills were promptly paid, and, from the time he
was ten, he received a liberal allowance&mdash;far too
liberal for his own good. His vacations were spent
at school or at some gay summer resort, and he was
allowed to do pretty much as he pleased, provided
he did not run in debt. So that it was not to be
wondered at that the boy had grown up wild and
selfish and brutal. He had never had a home since
he could remember, and thus far in life he had<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
found that money would secure about everything
that he wanted.</p>

<p>Once or twice his guardian had remonstrated
with him mildly about his low standing in his
classes, or the reports of idleness and mischievous
behavior in the school-room, but his private opinion
was, “Boys will be boys, and he’ll settle down and
be steady enough, after a while.”</p>

<p>It was at Crawford’s own request that he had
been sent to the high school. The first year he had
gotten on fairly well, but this second year his conduct
had been so unsatisfactory, that Mr. Horton
and Professor Keene had both written to Mr. Chase,
and that gentleman had at last come to the conclusion
that he must have a serious talk with his ward.</p>

<p>So, desirous to have it over as soon as possible,
he went to Crawford’s rooms the next day after the
trouble in section D. He found the boy stretched
out in a big easy-chair, a cigarette in his mouth and
a novel in his hand.</p>

<p>“Faugh!” the lawyer exclaimed in a tone of disgust,
as Crawford sprang up; “do throw away that
vile-smelling thing. A good cigar is bad enough,
but how anybody can abide the smell of cigarettes,
is more than I can understand.”</p>

<p>Crawford tossed the objectionable roll into the
grate, as he said, with a laugh, “Pity you don’t
smoke, sir. You don’t know how much you miss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>“Pity you <em>do</em>, I should say,” replied Mr. Chase,
sternly. “You’ll ruin your health and spoil your
brains if you don’t stop it. In short, my boy, I’ve
come to the conclusion that it’s high time for you to
turn over a new leaf. I am not at all pleased with
the reports I have from your teachers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know, then,” exclaimed Crawford, in a
tone of relief.</p>

<p>“Know what? That you’ve been idling away your
time and playing silly tricks here, as you have at the
other schools you’ve attended? George, there must
be an end of this. You are not a little boy any
longer. Here you are seventeen&mdash;nearly eighteen
years old&mdash;almost a man. It is time that you
showed some ambition, and set to work to make
something of yourself.”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed lazily and indifferently, as he
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you get a note from Keene, to-day?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Chase, briefly.</p>

<p>“Well, you will to-morrow then, and I’ll tell you
beforehand, the contents of it. Prof. Keene will
write to inform you that I am suspended for two
weeks. At the end of that time I may have the
privilege of returning, provided I will make a sufficiently
humble apology, and promise to be a good
little boy for the future. Much I’ll apologize!” he
added, with a scornful laugh.<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
He was wholly unprepared for the way in which
his news was received.</p>

<p>“Suspended!” exclaimed the lawyer, starting up.
“This is a pretty piece of business. Tell me what
you have been doing. You needn’t try to smooth it
over. Tell me the whole story, for I shall certainly
see Prof. Keene about it to-day.”</p>

<p>Considerably taken aback, but still trying to preserve
his careless manner, Crawford told what he
had done.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, all I have to say is, that you richly
deserve what you have got; and now let me tell you
that you may as well make up your mind first as
last, to go back at the end of the two weeks, and
make the apology and give the promise that Prof.
Keene requires&mdash;for that is what you’ve got to do.”</p>

<p>“Never! I’ll <em>never</em> do it,” cried Crawford, angrily.</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> do it, or I’ll put you where you’ll have
to behave yourself whether you like it or not,” was
the stern reply.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” questioned the boy.</p>

<p>“I mean, George, that I am beginning to realize
that you’ve had altogether too much liberty. It is
evident that you cannot be trusted to manage yourself
and do as you choose. You do not choose the
things or associates that I approve. I hear of you
around with that wild young Henderson continually,
and in places where you have no business to be; and<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
now you have disgraced yourself and gained a name
at school that you ought to be ashamed of. I’ll give
you just one more chance. If you attend to your
studies for the next two weeks and keep up with
your class, and at the end of that time make a suitable
apology to your teachers, and hereafter behave
yourself and try to redeem your character in the
school&mdash;very well.”</p>

<p>“And if I refuse to do all this?” questioned
Crawford, his face flushed with anger.</p>

<p>“If you refuse,” said the lawyer, slowly, “I will
put you in a reform school, if I can’t find any other
place where you will be forced to behave yourself.”</p>

<p>Crawford fairly choked with rage.</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll run away first,” he sputtered.</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed. “I’ll risk that,” he said. “A
very brief experience of roughing it, and earning
your own living, would bring you to your senses.
No, George, you’ve come to a turning place in your
life. Now make up your mind to face the situation
manfully, and make a record that you and I can both
be proud of. I’ll be around again in a day or two,
and I am sure that you will have made up your
mind not to be so foolish as to throw away this
chance.”</p>

<p>Crawford had never been taught to control his
temper, and he gave full vent to his furious anger,
after the departure of his guardian. He fumed and<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
raged like an overgrown child, and vowed that he
would never “knuckle under to Keene and Horton
to please old Chase.” He had just begun to cool off a
little when Henderson appeared. His face was as
black as Crawford’s as he flung himself into a chair
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You look about as I feel, Crawford; wonder if
you’ve had as pleasant an interview with your old
man as I’ve had with mine.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a sweet lecture from old Chase,” replied
Crawford, moodily, “and I’ve been trying ever since
he left to decide whether or no I’ll cut the whole
business and clear out somewhere. I’ve more than
half a mind to go out west and go to work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, don’t think of that. You’d be a big fool
to clear out when you can have all the money you
want here.”</p>

<p>Crawford looked up quickly. “And you,” he
said, “are you going to go back and promise to be a
good little boy?”</p>

<p>“Expect I’ve got to,” replied Henderson, moodily.</p>

<p>“Well, I never would have believed you’d back
down so quickly,” said Crawford, scornfully.</p>

<p>Henderson’s face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“I’ve no choice in the matter,” he said, shortly.
“The old man says if I don’t I can shift for myself
hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s my case too. Why not go out west<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
together? We’ve heads and hands of our own&mdash;why
shouldn’t we earn our living for three years? Chase
can’t keep me out of my money after I’m twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough to talk about earning a living,”
said Henderson, impatiently, “but I tell you
what, Crawford, you’d sing another tune after you’d
tried it a few months. You wouldn’t find it much
like living as you do here, driving out when you
choose, and always having your pockets full of
money.”</p>

<p>“They are anything but full most of the time,”
put in Crawford.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you can get all the credit you want. It
would be a very different thing, I tell you, if you
had nothing but what you earned. Neither you nor
I have learned anything by which we could earn a
dollar,” said Henderson, gruffly.</p>

<p>“But I say, Hendy, it will be mighty tough to
have to go back to school and eat humble pie. Think
how the fellows’ll chaff us if we meekly agree to be
good little boys and keep the rules hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em chaff,” growled Henderson. “We’ll
soon show them that we mean to play our little
games in the future about as we’ve done in the
past.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to promise not to do anything of
the sort before we can go back,” objected Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“Promise!” echoed Henderson scornfully. “Who
cares for a promise? We’ll get back on our promise
and then forget all about it. What cuts me
in this business,” he went on, moodily, “is that
I’ve got to drop out of the company. I was a fool
not to think of that before I told that yarn to
Bobby.”</p>

<p>“I declare, I haven’t once thought of that. You’ll
have to resign, of course,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Of course,” echoed Henderson. “It makes me
mad as fury to think that I was such a fool to get
into a scrape like this just now, when it’s so near
the drill. I believe we’d have won the prize sure
this year, for the fellows are so wild to get it away
from Company A, that every man of ’em has worked
with a will. I was going to give them extra drills
once or twice a week evenings, for this last month,
and now with a new captain they won’t stand half
as good a chance.”</p>

<p>“I declare that’s too bad, Henderson. Wish now
I’d never sent that note in to you.”</p>

<p>“You can’t wish it so much as I do,” said Henderson.
“But there is no use crying over spilt
milk. Maybe, Company C will win after all. We
must try to think of some way to help their chances.
But you see, Crawford, it’s enough sight worse
for me to go back than for you&mdash;since you’ve no
rank to lose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>Crawford drummed on the table and looked
thoughtful. After a moment’s silence he said, “It
<em>is</em> harder for you than for me, Henderson, and I
suppose if you are going back I must keep you
company, since I got you into this fix.”</p>

<p>“Shake hands on it,” said Henderson quickly,
holding out his hand. “I was awfully afraid you’d
refuse, Crawford, and to have gone back without
you would have been altogether too much for me.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to be mighty careful for a while
at any rate. Bobby will watch us with all the eyes
he has,” said Crawford gloomily.</p>

<p>“Bobby!” said Henderson with a sneer. “I
reckon we’re sharp enough to hoodwink Bobby, and
if with the help of Coyle and Green and the rest of
our crowd we don’t make it lively for those precious
L. A. O.’s, I miss my guess, that’s all. But now, see
here&mdash;the governor says that if I don’t stand as
well in class as I have done, or if I give Bobby
any cause to complain of me hereafter, then that’s
the end of it. I can drop out of high school and go
where I like, but never a dollar will he give me if I
starve.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Crawford. “He’s in earnest,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I should say so. I never would have believed
he’d cut up so rough,” growled Henderson.</p>

<p>“My orders are much the same,” said Crawford;<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
“only, as the money belongs to me after all, Chase
can’t carry it with quite such a high hand, you
know. I hate the idea of it all, though. Think of
going back and pegging away like Clark, and Gordon
and that lot, and never have any fun,” grumbled
Crawford, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh bosh! You’ve brains enough, Crawford, and
after all it’s time you did brace up and work a little.
It’s just laziness that has kept you so low in class,
and if you half try, you can stand as high as Clark
or Gordon. Only think how that would grind them.”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed. He was secretly pleased at
the other’s estimate of his ability, and the idea of
standing as high, or possibly higher than Clark and
Gordon was an alluring one.</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind to try it,” he said. “It would
be something new under the sun for me to go digging,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Henderson. “I fancy it would
astonish some people; and see what an advantage it
would give you, too. Bobby comes down on you
twice as hard as he does on me, and it’s only because
I stand high in class and you don’t. Now, you just
go to work, and Bobby will soon be so proud of you,
and so delighted at the change, that he will wink at
lots of things that now he would not overlook;
while Chase will be so pleased that everything will
go smoothly in that quarter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but, Hendy,” objected Crawford, “think
how slow and stupid it will be&mdash;just deadly dull&mdash;all
hard work and no fun.”</p>

<p>“No fun? Don’t you believe that. You and I
will be models of good behavior in the school-room,
but all the same if we don’t make life a burden to
Bobby, then I miss my guess.”</p>

<p>“But how, how?” questioned Crawford eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, this way. We’ll plan the mischief, and
let the rest of the Antis execute it, and bear the
blame. We’ll see all the fun, and go scot free.”</p>

<p>“They won’t agree to that,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“You see if they don’t. It will cost something,
but if I carry off the honors of the class, I’m sure
my dad will be ready enough to increase my allowance,
and Chase would do the same for you,
wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Probably, but what then?” questioned Crawford.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;a spread for the Antis now and then, or
an excursion down the bay&mdash;we footing the bills&mdash;will
buy over all our crowd, I reckon. As to Green
and Coyle, they’ve <em>got</em> to do as we say, till they
can pay the money we’ve lent ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, that <em>is</em> a scheme,” said Crawford, thoughtfully;
“I wonder if we can carry it out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why not,” replied the other; “and by
the way there’s another thing,&mdash;we must start in
on it to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“Studying, you mean?” queried Crawford.</p>

<p>“We must do that, but that was not what I was
thinking of. We must stir up a rumpus in the
class-room to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“How can we? and why not wait till we go
back?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see that if there is no disorder
while we’re away, and plenty of it after we come
back, Bobby’ll lay it all at our door. As to how&mdash;let’s
call a meeting of the Antis here this evening.
We can plan enough to make things lively in the
school-room for a week to come, and if we promise
the fellows a spread next week, they’ll be ready
enough to carry out our plans.”</p>

<p>So it was that a message reached every one of the
Antis before six o’clock that evening, and almost
every one responded to the call. Some of them
were really bad boys, more were neither good nor
bad, but ready to follow any leader who promised
them “fun.”</p>

<p>The session that day had been the most quiet and
orderly one of the year, and Mr. Horton had
thought to himself that he might hope for a continuance
of this state of things for two weeks, at least.
He found out his mistake before an hour of the second
day was over. There was no act of open disorder
or disobedience, but the Antis were restless
and noisy, ready to laugh at the slightest excuse,
and to keep on laughing as long as they dared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>When, in the history recitation, one of them remarked
that “Warren Hastings went to the same
school and sat on the same seats as the pheasants
of his native country,” an uproarious burst of laughter
followed, and all through the session similar
blunders were made in the gravest and most innocent
manner imaginable, by different boys. When
the hour came for the algebra recitation, an unusual
quiet prevailed in the room, and when Mr. Horton
sent Reed to the closet for a piece of chalk, more than
one boy waited breathlessly for what was to follow.</p>

<p>Reed flung open the door and reached up to the
shelf for the chalk-box, but the next moment it fell
from his hands, and with a cry, he sprang back and
slammed the door, but not before a snake had
slipped out into the room. It was a big black fellow,
nearly three feet long, and as it wriggled about
under the seats, there was such a commotion in the
room, that for a moment the teacher could not
make himself heard; and in that moment Green
flung open the door, and the snake was quickly
hustled out into the hall. A girls’ class-room was
directly opposite, and to the delight of the disorderly
element, the girls’ door stood ajar, and the boys succeeded
in driving the snake <em>accidentally</em> through
the opening. Then ensued shrieks and screams as
the girls jumped up on desks and seats, some of
them even mounting to the window-sills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>But in a moment Mr. Horton, understanding
what the noise in the girls’ room meant, appeared
there, seized the snake by the tail, and flung it from
the window.</p>

<p>When order was restored, and the teacher questioned
his own class, every boy denied all knowledge
as to how the snake came to be in the closet,
and although Mr. Horton had his own opinion on
the subject, he had no proof, and could do nothing.</p>

<p>The next day was no better. Never had the class
been more trying or more disorderly than in the
two weeks that followed, and never had the teacher
found it so difficult to decide whom to punish.</p>

<p>The L. A. O.’s were almost in despair. It was in
the second week that a meeting was held, and the
matter very earnestly talked over.</p>

<p>“It does seem a shame that a few mean fellows
should be able to upset everything as they do in
this class,” Gordon said indignantly. “I did hope
that it would be different at least while Crawford
and Henderson were away. I thought that they
were at the bottom of it all, but that can’t be, for it
has been worse than ever for the last week. Does
anybody know who <em>is</em> the ringleader?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me the Antis are <em>all</em> ringleaders,” said
Raleigh.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out who put the snake in the closet,”
announced Hamlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Who, who?” shouted a dozen voices eagerly.</p>

<p>“Green,” replied Hamlin.</p>

<p>“How’d you find out?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“I was in Smith’s bird-store down the avenue
yesterday. I’ve bought fancy pigeons of him several
times, and he’s a friendly sort of chap, and as I
happened to think of that snake, I asked him if he
had sold one within a week or two. He said yes&mdash;he
sold one to a sandy-haired fellow about my size&mdash;a
fellow with an anchor on his left hand. Well,
that fits Green to a T.”</p>

<p>“So it does. So he was at the bottom of that;
and I know it was Coyle that mixed up all our
overshoes yesterday, so it took us an age to sort ’em
out. I don’t see the fun in such tricks, for my
part,” said Raleigh.</p>

<p>“Well, say, boys&mdash;what are we going to do
about it? If every L. A. O. in the class should get
a hundred this quarter, it wouldn’t bring our class
record up to a decent mark, so long as the Antis cut
up as they do.”</p>

<p>“Does every fellow except us here belong to the
Antis?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Yes, all except Clark,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“I say it’s a shame that Clark’s name is not on
our roll,” broke in Hamlin. “<em>I</em> believe he’s a splendid
fellow, and I don’t think we do right to shut him
out just because of what his father has done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>A silence followed, while the boys looked at one
another uneasily.</p>

<p>“It isn’t all&mdash;his father,” remarked one.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it’s the things that happened the first of
the year,” said another.</p>

<p>“But I, for one, don’t believe that he deserved
the blame he got in either of those cases,” said
Hamlin boldly; “and no one can deny that he’s the
best all-around scholar in the class; and as to
deportment, no fellow could do more to help our
record than he does.”</p>

<p>“He’s too much of a prig,” muttered one; while
the Georgian, saying something about “convicts,”
turned away and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>With a disappointed air, Hamlin dropped the
so evidently unwelcome subject of Clark’s admission
to the society, and the discussion of what should be
done was resumed.</p>

<p>“Seems as if we might persuade a few of the
Antis to come over to our side,” said Raleigh.
“Some of the smaller fellows&mdash;Freeman and Vale,
for instance.”</p>

<p>“Vale might possibly be talked over, but Freeman
seems to be a hopeless case. I’ve done my best, but
he’s too much in with the worst ones. I don’t
think it’s any use to talk to him,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s try Vale again. You tackle him,
Gordon, and I’ll try Claflin, and the rest of you see
if you can talk over anybody else,” said Hamlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if it would be possible to get Bobby to
divide the section, and mark the L. A. O.’s and the
Antis separately,” suggested Gordon thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“We might talk to him about it. He’ll do anything
he can to help us, I know,” said Hamlin.</p>

<p>For an hour the discussion was continued, but
when the boys separated it was with a most uncomfortable
sense of the fact that&mdash;try as they
might&mdash;they never could change the reputation of
section D so long as nearly half of their number
were determined to do all in their power to prevent
such a change.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton willingly agreed to keep the records
of the Antis separately, but he told the boys that
that could make no real difference, since the section
must rank according to its marks as a whole.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">VERY NEARLY AN ACCIDENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hamlin’s failure to induce the L. A. O.’s to admit
Clark to their society made him the more determined
to show all possible friendliness himself
towards his lonely schoolfellow, and he made it a
point to walk to and from school with him, or to
have a chat with him at recess, as frequently as he
could. Clark appreciated the other’s kindness, and
understood perfectly well that it was through no
lack of effort on Hamlin’s part that he&mdash;Clark&mdash;was
not asked to join the L. A. O.’s.</p>

<p>Several other boys, Gordon and Graham among
them, began to follow Hamlin’s example so far as
to nod and say a pleasant word to Clark now and
then, but he felt that they were doing this merely
to please Hamlin, and did not respond very cordially
to their advances.</p>

<p>As to Freeman&mdash;Clark’s attempts to draw him
away from the Crawford crowd had signally failed.
Freeman seemed to have lost all desire for his
cousin’s companionship, and coldly and even curtly<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
refused all Clark’s invitations to walk or talk with
him.</p>

<p>Clark had little time and less inclination in these
days for visiting, but he went occasionally to see his
aunt and cousins. One afternoon he found Edith
alone, and looking so pale and troubled that he
could not help asking what was the matter.</p>

<p>The girl’s lip trembled, and her blue eyes filled
with tears as she answered simply, “I’m so worried
about Ray, Stanley.”</p>

<p>“What about him, Edith? Is it anything in
which I can help you?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. He is so changed lately. He
used to be the dearest boy, and now, since he has
been with Crawford and Henderson so much, he is
so different. He doesn’t seem to care for mamma or
me, and he goes out evenings and won’t tell us
where he goes, and he seems to have lost all interest
in his school work. His last report was the poorest
he has ever had.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Edith,” Clark answered, “I’ve tried
to get him away from that set, but he doesn’t care to
be with me any more. He as much as told me to
‘mind my own business’ and let him alone, the last
time I spoke to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Edith, “that’s the way he answers
me. But Stanley, Ray isn’t really a bad boy, and
I’m sure that something is troubling him, and that
is what makes him so cross, lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it is his low rank in class,” suggested
Clark.</p>

<p>Edith shook her head. “No, it’s something more
than that, I’m sure,” she said. Then she added earnestly,
“Don’t give him up, Stanley. He has always
looked up so to you, and I’m sure he does care for
you a great deal more than for those horrid big fellows
that he goes with now, and&mdash;and, we <em>must</em> get
him away from them somehow.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and Clark’s face expressed the
sympathy he felt.</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I can, cousin Edith. If only Crawford
and Henderson wouldn’t come back to school, I think
there would be much less trouble. They are the evil
influence in the class,” he said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the evil influence that is leading my
brother astray,” said Edith, sadly.</p>

<p>After this conversation, Clark was constantly on
the watch for any opportunity to help his young
cousin, not only for his own sake, but yet more for
that of the sister whose loving heart was so heavily
burdened with anxiety on her brother’s account.
Clark had the true knightly spirit, and counted it
the duty of a boy to care for his mother and sisters,
and ward off from them, as far as possible, all sorrow
and trouble. No mother ever had a more tender,
thoughtful son than his mother had in him, and
since he had no sister, he felt himself in duty bound<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
to do for Edith, as far as he could, what her own
brother failed to do; and above all, to bring back
that brother to the path of duty and uprightness
from which he had strayed.</p>

<p>But how to do this was the question&mdash;since Freeman
avoided him and responded so coldly to all his
advances. Clark pretended not to see this, and persisted
in being friendly, yet he felt more than a little
discouraged, and was often tempted to give it up, and
leave the boy to do as he would. It was only the
remembrance of Edith’s sorrowful face that kept
him from doing so.</p>

<p>Out of school hours, Freeman now spent half his
time in Crawford’s rooms, and during the weeks of
Crawford’s and Henderson’s absence, he spent every
recess with Coyle, Green, and others of like character.</p>

<p>When it was known in school that Crawford and
Henderson had been suspended, there was much
wondering and speculation among the L. A. O. as to
whether or no they would return and make the apology,
and give the promise required. After the meeting
at Crawford’s rooms, the Antis knew that the
two boys would return, but they took good care not
to let the L. A. O.’s know anything about the matter.</p>

<p>Every face in the room was full of eager interest
and curiosity, as nine o’clock approached on the
morning after the two weeks were ended.</p>

<p>When, after the opening exercises, Prof. Keene<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
entered the room followed by Crawford and Henderson,
there was a silence that could be felt. Every
eye was fastened on the two boys, who stood with
downcast faces while Prof. Keene said a few earnest
words to the class.</p>

<p>In spite of their bravado, and the hidden purpose
that sustained them, both boys found it more of an
ordeal than they had anticipated to stand there and
acknowledge that they had done wrong and were
sorry for it, and to promise that they would endeavor
from that time on to keep all the rules of
the school, and give no further cause of complaint.</p>

<p>Some of the Antis began to clap, as the two slipped
into their seats, but Prof. Keene stopped that instantly,
remarking sternly that this was no occasion
for applause.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the session, Mr. Horton
threw more than one puzzled glance at the two boys.
There was something in their faces that he could not
understand, but they certainly gave him no cause for
complaint, for they were models of good behavior.</p>

<p>The L. A. O.’s cast many curious and wondering
glances at them also as the hours passed, and these
two, who had so long been ringleaders in disorder,
sat apparently unconscious of the half-subdued buzzing
and whispering and laughter of their own set,
who seemed to be intensely amused at this new
state of things. And when not only Henderson, but<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
Crawford as well, had perfect recitations in each
study, the surprise of the L. A. O.’s was evident, to
the ill-concealed delight of the Antis.</p>

<p>After school, Mr. Horton detained the two boys
to say a few earnest words to them, and then to tell
them how much pleasure their fine recitations and
orderly deportment had given him. As he begged
them to use their influence, which he knew to be
great, on the side of law and order, Crawford hung
his head and a flush of shame dyed his cheeks as
he thought how little he deserved commendation;
but Henderson looked boldly into his teacher’s eyes
and coolly promised to do his best.</p>

<p>“I say, Henderson, you’re a bigger hypocrite than
I am,” said Crawford, as they went down stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! What’s one lie more or less?” said
the other coolly. “Besides, I’m going to be a model
of good behavior now, you know&mdash;a perfect little
lamb,” and he laughed at the remembrance of
“Bobby’s” face, and the way they had “taken him
in.”</p>

<p>Never had Mr. Horton been so perplexed and
so worried and tormented in his class-room, as in
the weeks that followed the return of Crawford and
Henderson. Having no clue to the real state of the
case, he was completely deceived, and took the
greatest satisfaction in the change in these two,
while at the same time he was at his wit’s end to<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
understand what caused the increasing disorder and
disturbance in the room, and who was at the bottom
of it all.</p>

<p>The L. A. O.’s, after much persuasion, had induced
three of the Antis to change sides, so that now there
were twenty-three L. A. O.’s and thirteen Antis besides
Crawford and Henderson. One boy had left
the class, and Clark belonged to neither side, so the
L. A. O.’s had a large majority; but all the same,
thirteen bad boys, especially with two such leaders
as Crawford and Henderson, can accomplish a deal
of mischief, and this thirteen certainly did.</p>

<p>Could Mr. Horton have been an unseen listener at
a spread given to the Antis by Crawford and Henderson
at the rooms of the former, he would have
understood the matter, for the boys, as they disposed
of the feast, laughed and rejoiced over the
success of their schemes, and planned yet more and
more exasperating trials for their long-suffering
instructor.</p>

<p>Among those present at Crawford’s “spread” was
Charlie Reed. Thus far Reed had looked upon life
as a huge joke, and his one purpose was to get as
much fun as possible out of every hour in the day.
He had refused to join the L. A. O.’s, because he
declared that there was “no fun” in keeping the
rules and working for honors. So he was always
ready to carry out any mischievous suggestion of<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
the Antis, and not a little of the class disorder might
justly have been laid at his door. And after all, he
meant no harm. With him it was pure thoughtlessness
and love of mischief. One of his favorite
amusements was to adorn the blackboard, out of
school hours, with absurd sketches of the boys or of
the teachers.</p>

<p>One morning before school he had drawn a sketch
of a very dudish young man and a lady arrayed in
bridal costume; and, lest anybody should fail to
recognize the intended likenesses, he had written
above this artistic production the legend, “Bobby
leading Miss Carr to the altar.”</p>

<p>The boys shouted, as Reed finished his sketch, for
Miss Carr was the oldest teacher in the school, certainly
twice Mr. Horton’s age, and not at all prepossessing
in appearance.</p>

<p>Suddenly a boy at the window called out, “Hi,
fellows&mdash;look over there. There she comes now,
and isn’t she a daisy!”</p>

<p>The boys rushed to the window. It was a rainy
morning, and Miss Carr, in waterproof and overshoes,
was picking her way through the puddles,
and, as it happened, Mr. Horton, who had overtaken
her a moment before, was holding his umbrella over
her head as they crossed the street.</p>

<p>In watching these two, the boys forgot all about
the sketch on the board, even Reed himself never<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
giving it a thought, and there it was when Clark, a
moment later, entered the room, Mr. Horton being
only a few steps behind him. At that instant
somebody cried out in smothered tones, “You’re in
for it, Reedy. Look at the board.”</p>

<p>Reed started up with a cry of dismay, but dropped
into his seat again as he heard Mr. Horton’s voice
in the hall.</p>

<p>Clark glanced at the board, and taking in the
situation, instantly snatched the eraser and rubbed
out the drawing as he passed the board. It was
barely done before Mr. Horton entered the room.
He looked in surprise at Clark turning away from
the board, but the boy quietly took his seat, while
Reed, with a sigh of relief, settled back in his; and
as it was almost nine o’clock, the teacher asked no
questions.</p>

<p>At recess, Reed joined Clark, who was walking up
and down the sidewalk alone, as usual.</p>

<p>“It was awfully good of you to rub out my
scrawl, Clark,” he said.</p>

<p>Before Clark had time to reply, Hamlin joined
him, and, with a nod, he turned away from Reed,
and the latter, after a moment’s hesitation, strolled
back to the boys in the playground.</p>

<p>It was that same day that Clark took a roundabout
way home for the sake of the air and
exercise. He was walking slowly down a shady,<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
pleasant street, when he noticed a pretty little
three-year-old girl coming down the steps of a
handsome house near the corner. The little thing
had evidently escaped from her nurse, for she cast
anxious glances back at the open door as she trotted
across the sidewalk. She was just in the middle of
the street, when a fire-engine came dashing around
the corner at full speed. The child, hearing the
gong and seeing the galloping horses coming straight
towards her, stopped short in a bewildered fashion,
too frightened even to cry out. It was impossible
for the driver to stop the horses or turn them aside
enough to pass her, but in that instant of time
Clark sprang forward, his rapid rush carrying both
himself and the child just out of the way of the
engine. He and the little girl both rolled in the
dirt, but neither was hurt beyond a bruise or two.</p>

<p>As he got on his feet and lifted the frightened
child, she began to cry and held out her arms to her
mother, who, with a white, shocked face, came running
down the steps. She held the little one close,
and for a moment she could not speak, but then her
eyes filled with tears of gratitude as she turned to
Clark and tried to thank him. But, boy-like, Clark
felt shy and embarrassed now, and tried to slip
away through the crowd that had quickly gathered.</p>

<p>“Do tell me your name,” the mother pleaded
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>Clark opened his lips to give it, but seeing a
reporter whip out his notebook and pencil, listening
eagerly for the answer, and not wanting to figure as
a newspaper hero, he said quickly, “I’m <em>very</em> glad
that the little girl was not hurt,” and lifting his hat,
slipped through the crowd and was gone.</p>

<p>With a disappointed look, the mother carried her
little girl into the house, while the reporter, casting
an injured glance after Clark, proceeded to gather
from the crowd all the particulars of the affair.</p>

<p>When Clark reached the school-room the next
morning, Reed was talking away excitedly to a
group of the boys, who were listening and questioning
him with eager interest.</p>

<p>“And you didn’t find out who the fellow was?”
asked Crawford.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;he wouldn’t tell my mother what his
name was, and the reporter couldn’t find anybody in
the crowd that knew him,” said Reed.</p>

<p>“Lucky for your little sister that he happened to
be on hand just that minute, whoever he was,” said
Sherman.</p>

<p>Reed’s usually bright eyes were suspiciously dim
as he answered in a low tone, “Yes&mdash;I can’t bear to
think of it.” Then he added, “My father says he’d
give a hundred dollars to know who the boy was.”</p>

<p>“Queer idea, not to give his name,” remarked
Henderson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;he was a brave fellow, anyhow,” said
Crawford. “Tell you what&mdash;<em>I</em> wouldn’t care to
run in front of a fire-engine, going at the rate they
always do go.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Coyle, “He ran the risk of being
awfully hurt, if not killed.”</p>

<p>“That’s what <em>I</em> call courage,” remarked Hamlin
emphatically, going over to Clark, who had taken
his own seat on the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“Did you hear what Reed was telling, Clark?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw the account in the paper,” answered
Clark quietly, “but I didn’t know until just now
that the little girl was Charlie Reed’s sister. I
didn’t know where he lived.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it’s his only sister. She’s a beautiful
child, and they’re just devoted to her&mdash;the whole
family. I never saw Reed so stirred up over anything
before. You know he generally turns everything
into a joke, but he doesn’t feel like joking this
morning. Pity they can’t find out who the fellow
is&mdash;isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Clark muttered some unintelligible reply, and
Hamlin, surprised and a little disappointed at the
other’s apparent lack of interest, turned away to his
own seat.</p>

<p>Even to his mother Clark did not mention the
affair; and she, as she read the account in the paper,
had no suspicion that her own son was the modest<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
young hero who had refused to give his name; while
Reed never dreamed that it was his quiet schoolmate
that had saved his home from being a house of
mourning. But somehow, he could not forget the
affair, or shake off entirely the impression that it
had made on him. He began to realize that life is
not all “fun,” and the coarse jokes of the Antis began
to lose their flavor for him, and finally he
amazed and rejoiced the L. A. O.’s by asking for admission
to their number. The enthusiastic welcome
that he received from those whom he knew to be
the “best fellows in the class” was all that was
needed to make him heartily glad of the break that
he had made.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE COMPETITIVE DRILL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Henderson had tendered his resignation as captain
of Company C the day after he was suspended.
He was surprised that he had received no notice of
the acceptance of the resignation, and had more than
once questioned the officers of his company since
his return to school, but none of them knew anything
about the matter; so he was feeling very uncomfortable
about it, when, one morning, he received
a summons to Professor Keene’s office. He answered
the summons promptly. Ten minutes later,
he left the office with his face brighter than it had
been for many days.</p>

<p>“I say,” he said, as he joined Crawford, who was
waiting for him, “would you believe it, Crawford,
Keene won’t accept my resignation?”</p>

<p>“And you’re to remain captain?” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if Company C doesn’t win the prizes
this time, I’ll know the reason why. There’s Griffin
ahead. Come on, I want to speak to him.”</p>

<p>Griffin was first lieutenant of Company C, and
was quite as anxious for that company to win as<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
was Henderson himself, and so he entered heartily
into the latter’s plans for long and frequent drills
during the next four weeks.</p>

<p>Eager as the boys themselves were to win the
prizes, some of them were inclined to grumble before
the month was over. They didn’t think quite so
much practice was necessary; but though they
complained, they had to submit to the captain’s
orders.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that, as the important day
approached, the recitations did not improve, but the
teachers were lenient, and made all possible allowances.</p>

<p>This annual drill was always an affair of great
interest to all the pupils of the two high-schools.
Even the boys not in the battalion, and the girls,
were quite as much interested as the cadets themselves,
and this year the interest was increased by
the offer of a costly and very beautiful gold medal
in addition to the prize banner. The banner had
been held for the last two years by Company B of
the Eastern school, and of course that company and
that school were as determined to retain it, as the
companies of the Central were determined to win it.</p>

<p>There was no finer company in the battalion than
Company D, of which Gordon was captain and Hamlin
lieutenant. The boys of this company had a
hearty respect and affection for their officers, both<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
personally and officially. It was Gordon’s way to
do his best whatever the work in hand might be,
and through all the past year he had carried out
that principle in regard to his military duties as
well as in his work in the class-room; and because
he was always fair and just as well as friendly with
them, whether in the drill, on the playground, or
wherever they were together, the boys of his company
were always ready to carry out his wishes.
This year, they were one and all determined that
their captain should wear the gold medal, and they
themselves the red ribbons of the prize company.
Gordon himself wanted it too&mdash;of course he did&mdash;but
he would have scorned to win by any but fair
means, while Henderson was determined that by
fair means or foul, Company C should stand first.</p>

<p>The drill was to take place on the baseball
grounds. There were in the two schools seven
companies, and each was to drill for thirty or forty
minutes, four companies drilling the first afternoon,
and the remaining three, the second.</p>

<p>Company C was second on the list of the first
day, and Company D was the last on the next
day.</p>

<p>Henderson kept his company drilling from eight
till ten o’clock on the last night before the drill, and
neither he nor any of his men were in their seats
in the school-room, the next morning. In fact, very<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
few of the cadets in either school put in an appearance
that morning, and no very great interest was
manifested in the lessons by any of the pupils, and
the classes were dismissed an hour earlier than
usual.</p>

<p>The weather was all that could be desired, being
clear and cool for a summer day. The gates were
not to be opened till four o’clock, but long before
that time a great crowd had assembled, and horns,
bells and bugles kept up an unceasing din, while
gay silk banners bearing the letters of the different
companies, and canes and batons wound with ribbons
were waving everywhere.</p>

<p>Every high school pupil who could be there was
there, and all wore ribbons. The boys wore small
strips on which were printed the company letters,
but the girls fairly rioted in ribbons. Some wore
them as hat-bands, some as shoulder-knots with
long streamers. Many had batons wound with two
or three colors, with bows and streamers at the end,
while yet others, and these usually very bright or
pretty girls, wore the colors of two or three, or even
more companies, in one big cluster.</p>

<p>As soon as the gates were opened the seats were
rapidly filled, and long before the drill began every
one of the six thousand places was occupied.</p>

<p>Crawford had hired one of the boxes, and Freeman
sat there with him. Edith was there, too, but<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
she sat with some of her friends on the other side.
Edith was a very pretty girl, and Crawford would
gladly have given her a seat in his box. Indeed,
when he saw her, he sent Freeman to ask her to
join them, but she returned them a polite refusal,
and remained where she was, to Crawford’s secret
vexation; nor was this feeling lessened, when, a
little later, he saw the cordial welcome she gave to
Clark, and the readiness with which she made room
for him at her side.</p>

<p>The judges were three army officers, and promptly
at the appointed hour they appeared on the field, and
a moment later, Company A marched in on the opposite
side, welcomed by ringing cheers and shouts
from their friends, and ear-splitting horn salutes
from their foes&mdash;that is, those whose sympathies
were with other companies.</p>

<p>Quiet fell upon the throng of spectators as the
drill began, and all eyes watched the boys in blue,
some in breathless anxiety lest there be some slip
or blunder&mdash;some in equally great anxiety lest
there should not be.</p>

<p>The company did itself credit, and as all went
smoothly, its eager well-wishers began to believe
that this time A would surely stand first, when, almost
at the last moment, the captain dropped his
sword. Poor fellow&mdash;he felt badly enough about
it without the groan that he could not help hearing,<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
from the grand stand, and though not another slip
occurred, and he marched his men off the field in
fine style, he and they knew well that their chance
was gone.</p>

<p>As they passed off, Company C marched on. Henderson’s
dark face was full of grim determination,
yet there was a shadow of anxiety in his glance as
it rested for a second on the last man in the rear
rank. That was Baum. If any one blundered, it
was safe to be Baum; but Baum had done finely for
the past month, surely he would do his best to-day.
So ran Henderson’s thoughts, as he led his men forward.
No danger of Henderson making a blunder.
He meant to go to West Point yet, for all his tastes
were for a military life, and he had the manual at
his tongue’s end. No danger of his getting rattled.
He was sure of himself and sure of his men&mdash;all
but Baum.</p>

<p>And Company C did well. As Henderson’s strong
voice rang out, his orders were obeyed with the
promptness and exactness of clockwork. The
judges nodded approval, and made memoranda on
their programs, as order after order was given and
obeyed. Henderson’s eyes shone, and his heart
beat high with proud satisfaction, and then&mdash;then,
at last that wretched Baum blundered. When the
company was ordered to load and fire, lying down,
his discharge was so far behind the others that a<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
shout of derision broke from some of the rougher
boys among the spectators, and Henderson felt an
insane longing to seize Baum’s gun and whack him
over the head with it.</p>

<p>And Baum, knowing well what was in his captain’s
heart, felt <em>his</em> heart sink into his boots as he
wondered if he could possibly fire at all the second
time. How he did it he never knew, but the second
discharge was fine, and the poor fellow drew a breath
of relief as he braced himself to meet the storm that
he knew would burst upon his head the moment the
drill was over. And it did. Henderson hardly
waited to get off the field, before he burst into a
torrent of angry abuse and vituperation, so bitter and
so profane that it shocked the others into silence, and
no other boy said anything to Baum about what had
happened; and he, dropping into the most unnoticeable
place he could find, pulled his cap over his eyes
and brooded over his “hard luck.”</p>

<p>Henderson, his face still dark with anger, joined
Crawford and Freeman, and sat there glowering at
Company E. This being notoriously the worst
drilled of the seven companies, he had no fear of
its gaining the prize, and he gave but little heed to
what passed till Company B came on. Then he
roused himself, and hastily scrawling a line on a
slip of paper, told Freeman to “Give it to that cub
over yonder,” the cub referred to being Baum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Baum read the message, and his gloomy face
lightened a little, as he nodded to Henderson, and
then proceeded to tear the note into tiny bits, and
presently he slipped away.</p>

<p>Shouts and cheers greeted the appearance of Company
B, and banners bearing that letter were raised
and waved from every quarter. Pink was the company
color, and a large and very beautiful banner of
pink silk with B embroidered in the center, was set
up in the front row of the bleachers as the company
marched forward.</p>

<p>Henderson scowled, and whispered something to a
little fellow just then passing his seat with a basket
of candies and chewing gum for sale. A silver dollar
slipped into the basket, and a few minutes later
the candy boy delivered a second message to Baum,
who had returned to his seat.</p>

<p>Now all eyes were watching Company B, which
seemed in a fair way to win fresh laurels, as one
manœuvre after another was swiftly and dexterously
executed. There was no blundering Baum to spoil
the shooting, and the captain of Company B, easy
and self-possessed, was in no danger of dropping his
sword or committing any other blunder.</p>

<p>Henderson’s watchful face darkened yet more as
the minutes passed, and he cast uneasy glances
toward the quarter where Baum now sat among a
noisy group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>In one of the manœuvers the company approached
quite close to the place where this group was sitting,
and suddenly a score of voices shouted an
order, quite drowning the voice of the captain as he
gave an entirely different one. Only the men nearest
to the captain understood his order. The others,
confused by the unexpected call from the seats,
hesitated, wavered, and obeyed the wrong order, and
Company B’s chance for the prize was gone.</p>

<p>“Good, good!” hissed Henderson in Crawford’s
ear. “Baum managed that beautifully. I can
almost forgive him for his blunder now.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him to do it?” asked Crawford.</p>

<p>“’Course I did. Didn’t I tell you I’m bound to
have that banner by fair means or foul?” replied
Henderson. “We’re ahead now, spite of Baum’s
blunder,” he added, with his low, cruel laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, look! Somebody’s pulled down their
banner,” cried Freeman.</p>

<p>Sure enough, as Company B marched out with
flushed and frowning faces, their beautiful new silk
banner was suddenly discovered to be missing from
the place where it had been raised. Who did it, or
where it was, only Henderson, Baum and the candy
boy knew; but late that night, the banner, soiled
and rumpled, and looking as if it had been trailed
in the dirt, was left on the doorsteps of the captain
of Company B. The person who left it there rang<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
the bell and disappeared before the door was
opened.</p>

<p>A year before, Freeman would have been quick
to condemn such mean and contemptible doings as
these; but now he said nothing, as Henderson
openly rejoiced over the discomfiture of Company
B; and Crawford, though he said little, evidently
saw nothing amiss in the methods employed.</p>

<p>“Here come the F’s. No danger of their winning,”
Freeman said, as the final drill of the first
day began.</p>

<p>Company F was the last formed of the seven. It
had had but little practice, and nobody expected it
to win, and nobody’s expectations were disappointed.</p>

<p>There might about as well have been no school
the next day, for so great was the prevailing excitement
that it was impossible for the boys to settle
down to work.</p>

<p>The interest was even greater than on the first
day. Before school and at recess hot discussions
were carried on over the first three drills of the
previous day, and much sympathy was expressed
for Company B.</p>

<p>“It was a contemptible piece of business&mdash;calling
out the wrong order as those fellows did,” Hamlin
said indignantly, “and I, for one, am heartily
ashamed that any of our fellows had a hand in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>“Who says any of our fellows <em>did</em> have a hand
in it?” said Coyle, angrily.</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> they did, for I saw some of them yelling,”
replied Hamlin, “and a fellow that sat right by
them gave me the names of some of our fellows
who shouted the wrong order.”</p>

<p>“He might have been in better business,” growled
Coyle, to which Hamlin quickly responded, “<em>They</em>
might have been in better business. And then to
pull down B’s flag just then, was too mean for anything.”</p>

<p>“The B’s are all Easterns. It’s time the Centrals
got the prize,” cried Green.</p>

<p>“I want the Centrals to win, as much as anybody,
I guess,” replied Hamlin, “but if we can’t win fairly
I’d rather lose.”</p>

<p>“You would&mdash;would you?” said Henderson.
“Well, I wouldn’t, then. That banner and medal
ought to belong to a Central company. All’s fair
in love and war,” he added, winking at Green.</p>

<p>“Well, I know that Company D will do its level
best this afternoon, and I don’t believe that anybody
wants those prizes any more than we do, but
if we win, we’ll win fair,” answered Hamlin, and
Gordon, who had just joined the group, added
quietly, “So we will, Hamlin.”</p>

<p>“Not much danger of Company D winning,” said
Henderson with a sneer. “The good little boys will
get left again, this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;if yesterday’s doings are repeated,”
said Hamlin significantly, as the bell called them to
order.</p>

<p>Gordon and Hamlin were the only members of
Company D at school that morning, and Mr. Horton
dismissed them at one o’clock.</p>

<p>As they left the building Hamlin said, “Gordon,
I believe Henderson means to play us some mean
trick like that they served Company B yesterday.
He’s bound and determined to win the prizes, and I
believe that he’ll stop at nothing to gain his end.”</p>

<p>“I’m a good deal of your opinion, Hamlin,” Gordon
replied. “He’s perfectly unscrupulous, but I
really don’t believe that he could rattle us as he did
them yesterday. You see, we shall be on the lookout
for him, now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think myself that that plan would succeed
with our men, but you see he’ll probably hatch
up some new scheme that we haven’t thought of,”
said Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t borrow trouble, Hamlin,” said
Gordon. “We’ve only to do our best, and not worry
over what may happen.”</p>

<p>Again, as on the day before, Crawford and Freeman
were in one of the boxes, and Henderson was
with them, and Clark again joined Edith and her
friends, but to-day he was even more grave than
usual, and his dark eyes cast quick, searching glances<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
here, there and everywhere, but most frequently
at the end of the row, where Baum, Green, Coyle
and others of the Antis were gathered.</p>

<p>“Why Edith, you have come out in company colors
too, to-day,” Clark said suddenly, noticing the
pale blue ribbons she wore.</p>

<p>Edith colored a little. “The girls would make
me wear them,” she said. “They are all interested
in Company D. Two of them have brothers in that
company, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Clark, absently.</p>

<p>Edith, following the direction of his eyes, leaned
forward, and looked intently at the group of boys
he was watching. “Do all those boys belong in
your section?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Most of them do,” Clark answered, “and they
are no credit to the section either&mdash;some of them.”</p>

<p>“I wish Ray would come back here with us,”
Edith said, sadly. “He used to go everywhere with
me, but he never goes anywhere with me now.”</p>

<p>Clark longed to say something to comfort her,
but he did not know what to say, so he was silent.</p>

<p>Promptly at four o’clock, Company E appeared.
In spite of her troubled thoughts, Edith could not
help laughing, as a woman in the front seat, at
sight of her boy in the ranks, cried out, “There he
is! There’s Johnny!” and as a welcoming cheer
greeted the approaching company, Johnny’s mother<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
not only joined heartily in it, but, rising, swung her
umbrella in the air and pounded the rail in front
with it, while she shouted, “Hurrah for Company
E!”</p>

<p>But the crowd was a good-natured one, and those
around her only laughed as they dodged to avoid
the blue umbrella that seemed quite likely to hit
somebody over the head, so great was its owner’s
excitement.</p>

<p>Company E drilled well, and the joyful excitement
of “Johnny’s” mother increased as one evolution
after another was performed without mishap. But
alas! There are so many chances, and so many possible
mistakes! The captain of Company E was so
unfortunate as to lead his men so near the grand
stand in one of the marches, that the commanding
officer ordered them off, and this so confused the
men that their firing was by no means up to the
mark.</p>

<p>Company G, the next in order, had a fiery, nervous
little captain, who was himself the cause of
failure, as, in giving an order, he stepped back too
quickly, and ran into one of his men so violently
as to throw him down. The man recovered himself
well, without throwing anyone else out, but Company
G’s chance was lost, and that they realized
this was evident from the faces of the boys as they
left the field, passing near the entrance, the last of
the seven&mdash;Company D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>That this company had many friends among the
spectators was evident from the noisy welcome that
rang out at its approach, and not once during the
two days had such a general silence marked the intense
interest as now. Edith’s friends had eyes and
ears for nothing that was going on around them.
They scarcely breathed as Gordon’s clear voice rang
out, and his men, as if animated by a single spirit,
obeyed his orders.</p>

<p>Gordon’s sister sat next to Edith. Her fair face
was flushed with excitement, and her eyes never for
an instant turned away from the boys in blue, and
their young captain. Once, when a gentleman near
exclaimed, “That’s the finest shooting yet,” Bessie
Gordon’s hand clasped Edith’s tightly, and her eyes
shone with satisfaction, but she spoke no word.</p>

<p>The company had just obeyed the order to lie
down and load, when Stanley Clark, with a smothered
exclamation, sprang from his place and dashed
across to the open seats. As Edith looked after him
in surprise, Bessie gripped her hand again, crying
out, “Oh Edith, Edith, look!” and Edith looked
just in time to see a giant powder-cracker strike the
ground not two yards in front of the prostrate boys,
where it exploded with a tremendous bang, the
sound mingling with the discharge of the guns.</p>

<p>Instantly, there was a medley of shouts, cries,
cheers and hisses, but Company D and its captain<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
might have been blind and deaf for all the attention
they paid to the uproar. Not a man had flinched
when they saw that big cracker coming straight
towards their faces, and not a gun had failed to
send its volley at the command to “fire!”</p>

<p>Professor Keene and the other teachers quieted
the excited crowds in the seats as quickly as possible,
and without the slightest interruption the
drill proceeded, but when it was over, and Captain
Gordon, having saluted the chairman of the judges,
turned to lead his company off the field, the audience
went wild. Cheer upon cheer rang out. Banners,
handkerchiefs, ribbon-decked parasols were waved
with reckless disregard of everybody and everything,
while the retiring company was literally pelted
with flowers.</p>

<p>“It is evident that the audience has decided
which is the prize company,” remarked Professor
Keene with a smile, to Bessie Gordon, “and I quite
agree with the general verdict.”</p>

<p>Bessie’s eyes were full of quiet happiness, now,
but her cheeks were still a little pale from the nervous
excitement of seeing that blazing cracker flying
straight towards those faces that she knew would
not move a hair’s breadth to avoid it.</p>

<p>“Here comes the band,” cried half a dozen voices,
as the strains of martial music drew all eyes again
towards the field, where the regimental drill was<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
now to take place while the judges were making
their decision.</p>

<p>But nobody paid very much attention to this.
All were awaiting impatiently the announcement
of the decision, and when the chairman of the committee
declared Company D to have won the prizes,
cheer after cheer expressed the satisfaction of the
audience; and when the beautiful gold medal was
handed to Captain Gordon, his men looked as proud
and happy as if each one of them was to wear it
himself. It was evident that they did not take
half as much pride in their own red ribbons as they
did in their captain’s honors.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you proud of your brother?” said a girl
near Bessie; and Bessie answered frankly, “Indeed
I am, Mollie.”</p>

<p>“You have reason to be, Miss Bessie,” added Professor
Keene. “I am proud to have him in my
school. His influence is always on the right side.”</p>

<p>Bessie’s eyes shone with delight at this public
compliment to her brother; but Edith turned away
with tears in her eyes and an aching heart, because
her only brother could receive no such commendation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FREEMAN MAKES A DECISION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning’s mail carried to every member
of Company C, and also to Clark, Freeman and
Crawford, a request from Professor Keene to be at
his office that morning at ten o’clock. There was
some grumbling, as it was Saturday, and the summons
interfered with various holiday plans; but
more than one face was shadowed with uneasiness
and anxiety, and among this number was that of
Captain Henderson.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re in for it, Hen,” Crawford said
to him on the way to the school.</p>

<p>“They can’t prove anything against me,” replied
Henderson, uneasily; “not if you and Freeman
don’t blab.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t, of course, and I don’t believe Freeman
will. He’s a plucky little chap.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of him as you seem to be,
Crawford; but if he does let out anything, I’ll pay
him out for it. He may be sure of that,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>When they reached the school, they found most<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
of the company already there, and Clark and
Freeman appeared a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The professor told Clark, Crawford and Freeman
to remain in his office, while he led Henderson and
his company to one of the class-rooms.</p>

<p>Closing the door, he stood for a moment in
silence, looking from one to another of the faces
before him, and some of the boys felt plainly uncomfortable
beneath that searching glance. It
seemed an endless time to these before the professor
said, “Boys, I was intensely mortified over some
of the occurrences at the drill, yesterday. I can
make allowances for excitement and high spirits
and thoughtlessness; but that any of my boys should
have been guilty of such meanness and rowdyism,
such shameless and reckless efforts to prevent
others from winning the prizes, has pained and
shamed me more than I have words to express.</p>

<p>“In the four years that these competitive drills
have been held, there has never before been anything
like the outrageous affair of yesterday&mdash;the
throwing of that cracker.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, then went on slowly,
“When I think what the results might have been
had that cracker exploded <em>towards</em> the boys, I feel
as if no punishment could be too severe for those
who would risk the destruction of eyesight, or even
life itself, to keep others from winning a well-deserved<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
prize. It was only God’s mercy that
prevented such awful consequences.</p>

<p>“Think, for one moment, boys, how some of you
would be feeling to-day, if that deed of yesterday
had blinded or killed some of your schoolmates!</p>

<p>“A thorough investigation has been ordered, and
no effort will be spared to find out and to punish
the guilty persons, <em>unless</em> they confess their guilt.
If any boy will confess his share in the matter, I
will do my best to lighten his punishment, but anyone
who will not confess and who shall be proven
guilty need look for no mercy.”</p>

<p>While the professor spoke, some of the boys
shifted uneasily from one foot to the other, and
some cast furtive glances at Henderson, who stood
leaning against a desk, with a hard look in his
eyes and his lips close shut.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Professor Keene turned towards him.
“Henderson, what do you know about this affair?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Henderson looked full into the professor’s searching
eyes, and answered calmly, “Nothing whatever,
sir.”</p>

<p>“You had nothing to do with it in any way?”
pursued the professor.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>With a disappointed look and a half sigh, the
professor turned from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “you have heard Henderson’s
denial&mdash;now I call upon you. If anyone here
knows anything about this matter, I beg him, for
his own sake, to speak now. Do not let any school-boy
notion against telling of another keep anyone
silent. This is a very grave affair, and it is your
<em>duty</em> to tell whatever you know about it.”</p>

<p>As the professor paused, Baum lifted his head
and took a step forward, but the professor did not
see him, and a threatening look from Henderson
made him drop his eyes and keep silence.</p>

<p>“So,” said the professor sadly, “you all deny any
knowledge of this thing? Boys, you don’t know
how heartily I wish that I could believe you, but I
am sorry to say that there is evidence against some
of you, and some of you have not given your
teachers reason to put implicit faith in your statements.
I sincerely hope, however, that in this case
you have told the truth. You will remain here
until I return.”</p>

<p>He left the room, closing the door after him.</p>

<p>The boys did not talk much after his departure.
Henderson tried to laugh the matter off, but no one
responded to his flippant remarks, and, after a little,
he sauntered to the window and stood there looking
out in silence.</p>

<p>Meantime, the professor questioned Crawford,
but, like the others, he steadily denied any knowledge
in regard to the affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>“You may join the others in the class-room,”
said the professor, and, as Crawford left the office,
he turned to Freeman. Freeman’s face was pale
and disturbed, and as he stood before the professor
his eyes were downcast, and he looked as if he
might himself be the guilty one.</p>

<p>“Freeman, will you answer truthfully the questions
that I am going to ask you?” said the professor.</p>

<p>He was feeling greatly disheartened, for he did
not believe that the boys that he had questioned
were all of them innocent or ignorant, yet every one
had declared himself so.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Freeman’s voice was low, and he did
not look up as he answered.</p>

<p>“Do you know who called out the wrong order to
Company B last Thursday?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who threw the cracker at Company
D yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you any knowledge whatever about these
doings&mdash;who suggested them, or who had any part
in carrying them out?”</p>

<p>Lower yet dropped the boy’s head, and his voice
was almost inaudible, but again the answer was “No,
sir.”</p>

<p>The professor’s tone changed then. There was a
ring of contempt in it as he said curtly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“You may go.” And Freeman went.</p>

<p>Then the professor turned to Clark.</p>

<p>“Clark,” he said, sadly, “I can forgive anything
sooner than a lie. Will you tell me the truth?”</p>

<p>“If I can, sir. I will certainly tell you nothing
<em>but</em> the truth,” replied the boy. His eyes met his
teacher’s as boldly as Henderson’s had done, but
with a very different expression in their clear depths.</p>

<p>The professor gave a sigh of relief. He was skilled
in reading boys’ faces, and he felt instinctively that
he could trust this boy.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you know about this miserable
business,” he said.</p>

<p>“I know very little,” replied Clark. “I had been
afraid that there might be trouble because of the
strong feeling in regard to the prizes; and while
Company D was drilling, I saw a lot of the rougher
fellows whispering together. Then I saw one of
them leave his seat and speak to a boy&mdash;not a high-school
boy I am sure, certainly not a Central boy&mdash;and
give him something, and then this boy walked
to the back of the stand. He waited a moment, and
then I saw him light a match, and it flashed across
my mind what he was going to do. I ran across to
try to stop him, but the stand was so crowded that
I couldn’t reach him in time. He saw me coming,
and I think that that made him throw the cracker
before he was quite ready, and maybe that is why<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
he threw it as he did, so that it did not explode
towards the boys.”</p>

<p>“He was gone, I suppose, before you could get to
him?” said the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, he disappeared. I think he dropped from
the back of the seats to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Should you know him if you should see him
again?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, sir,” replied Clark.</p>

<p>The professor mused for a few minutes, then he
asked, “Can you tell me the name of the boy who
talked with this fellow, and gave him something?”</p>

<p>Clark hesitated.</p>

<p>“I know who it was, Professor,” he said at last,
“but the boys of section D have more than once accused
me of telling tales, though I have never once
done so. In this case I think that you ought to
know who this boy was; but, sir, won’t you try to
find out some other way first? If you fail to find
out by other means, I cannot refuse to tell you, but
please do not ask me now.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my boy, I will not ask you to-day,
but I think likely it will be necessary for me to ask
you again later. I want to thank you, Clark, for
what you have told me. It is a relief to question a
boy upon whose word I can rely. I need not ask
you to keep silence as to what has passed this
morning. I know you will do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>He rose, and held out his hand, and Clark grasped
it and departed with a breath of relief that that ordeal
was over.</p>

<p>Crawford, Henderson and Freeman left the school
together, but Freeman turned off at the first cross-street.
He was in no mood for Crawford’s careless
gaiety and Henderson’s sneers and flings. He was
going along with his hands in his pockets and his
eyes on the ground, when, turning a corner, he almost
ran into his cousin. He would have passed on
without a word, but Clark put his arm affectionately
across his shoulders, and fell into step with him.</p>

<p>“I was just going around to your house, Ray, to
see if you would go with me for a tramp over the
hills,” he said; “I don’t feel like settling to work to-day,
and I don’t believe you do. Come on&mdash;won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Freeman, wearily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel equal to it?” Clark asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m well enough; ’tisn’t that,” replied the
boy.</p>

<p>Clark thought that he looked very far from well,
but he had his reasons for urging his request.</p>

<p>“You go on home, then, and tell Edith, so she
won’t be worrying about you, and I’ll go home and
get some luncheon to take along with us, and then
I’ll stop for you. We can take the cars up to the
end of the line, and walk the rest of the way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care. Suppose I might as well go
as to mope ’round at home,” said Freeman, and with
a cheery “That’s good, I’ll be at your house within
twenty minutes,” Clark hurried away.</p>

<p>It was cool and restful in the open car, and Clark,
seeing that his cousin was disinclined to talk, left
him to his thoughts, with only a word now and
then. Even after they left the car, and struck into
the woods, they spoke but little.</p>

<p>Clark led the way to a cool, shady spot where he
knew there was a spring of clear, cold water.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, “sit there and rest, Ray. That
big tree trunk makes a splendid support for a tired
back. I brought some lemons and sugar, and now
I’m going to make some lemonade with this spring
water. It’s almost as cold as ice. You can take
out the rest of the stuff while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>But when he returned with his kettle of lemonade,
the lunch-basket stood, unopened, where he had left
it, and his cousin sat with his eyes on the distant
hills&mdash;his thoughts evidently far away. Clark
made no remark, but set out the luncheon himself.</p>

<p>“Come now, pitch in, Ray,” he said, “I’m as hungry
as a bear, and I hope you are too. I don’t want
to have anything to lug home but the basket and
kettle. Here&mdash;try my lemonade,” and he filled a
glass, and passed it to his cousin.</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” objected Freeman, but Clark
laughed at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be. Take hold and keep me
company, else I shall be ashamed of my healthy appetite.”</p>

<p>With merry talk and gay jokes he beguiled Freeman
out of his despondent mood, and presently the
little fellow found himself eating and drinking, and
felt much the better for it. When the meal was
finished, Clark threw himself down on the grass, and
again a silence fell between the two. Clark was
wondering how he could win his cousin’s confidence,
and Freeman had fallen again into troubled thought.</p>

<p>“Ray, you don’t look happy,” said Clark, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Happy!” echoed the other, “I’m too miserable
to live.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me all about it, Ray?” said Clark,
in a voice so full of sympathy, that, in spite of himself,
Ray’s eyes filled with tears, but he choked them
back.</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing to tell,” he said, coldly.</p>

<p>Silence again, and once again Clark broke it.</p>

<p>“Ray,” he said, “do you remember your father?”</p>

<p>Freeman looked up in surprise at the question.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember him well,” he said. “I was
eight, you know, when he died. Oh, Stanley, I <em>wish</em>
my father had lived. I believe I’d be a better fellow
to-day, if he had.”</p>

<p>“I remember him so well,” said Clark, slowly.
“Mother used to tell me stories about him when he<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
was a boy. He was her twin brother, you know,
and she was as devoted to him as Edith is to you.
I used to think that if I could ever be such a boy as
Uncle Raymond was, I should be about right.”</p>

<p>Freeman’s eyes were shining now. He had forgotten
all about himself, and was thinking only of the
father whose death he had never ceased to mourn.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said eagerly, “almost the first thing I
can remember is walking in the street with him, and
feeling so proud because he was so grand and handsome,
and even now, it seems to me that he must
have been nobler and finer than most men. It
makes me proud to think I bear his name.”</p>

<p>“Raymond,” said Clark, earnestly, “are you bearing
it so that he would be proud of <em>you</em>&mdash;if he were
here now?”</p>

<p>The boy threw himself down, and burying his
face in his hands, broke into bitter sobs.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Stanley, no,” he cried; “I’m ashamed&mdash;ashamed,
when I think how I’ve dragged his dear
name in the dirt. Oh, what <em>shall</em> I do, what shall
I do!”</p>

<p>The agony of shame and bitter sorrow in that
woeful cry, wrung his cousin’s heart. He laid his
hand lovingly on the bowed head as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Turn right about, Ray, and make a new beginning.
Determine that from this time on you will never do
or say one thing that you would be ashamed to have
Uncle Raymond know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but you don’t know how bad I’ve been. Why,
Stanley, I lied to Prof. Keene this very morning. I
<em>did</em> know about that cracker. I carried the message
from Henderson to Baum, myself.”</p>

<p>“I knew you did, Ray.”</p>

<p>Freeman sat upright and stared in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“<em>How</em> did you know it?” he said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought to say I guessed it, for of course
I did not know <em>what</em> message you carried to Baum,
but I saw Henderson speak to you, and then I saw
you go to Baum, and I thought you gave him something.
Afterward, when I saw him hand something
to the rascal that fired that cracker, I guessed at
once that Henderson had sent you to do the abominable
errand for him.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell all this to the professor?” questioned
Ray.</p>

<p>“No, Ray, I gave the professor no names, but I
may have to tell him about Baum. I cannot tell
him about you.”</p>

<p>Freeman’s head went down on his hands again
and he groaned out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That isn’t all, either, Stanley. It was I that
snapped the marble that broke Raleigh’s glasses,
and I lied about that, too.”</p>

<p>“Did you do that, Ray? I was afraid it was you,
but I hoped I was mistaken. Why didn’t you own<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
up when Mr. Horton gave you the chance? He
wouldn’t have been hard on you. He knew it was
an accident,” said Clark.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t, Stanley. At least, I meant the
marble to hit Raleigh’s head, though of course, I
didn’t think of his glasses. I’ve had a hand in all
the mischief that has been done in the room these
last two terms, and I’ve lied like a trooper right
straight through it all. Stanley&mdash;I don’t believe I
can <em>help</em> lying now.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Ray!” Clark spoke sternly, now.
“Don’t be so weak as to give up trying to make
a man of yourself. I tell you, Ray, your father’s
son <em>must</em> be a true, honorable man. You have to
take his place in the world&mdash;fill his place to your
mother and Edith.”</p>

<p>“Oh I wish I could, Stanley. You don’t know
how much I wish it sometimes. You think I don’t
try, but I do. Lots of times I’ve made up my mind
that I would break with Crawford and all that lot,
and then he’d come and coax me to go for a drive or
a sail, and I’d give in and go and do anything they
wanted me to, though I knew all the time I was
breaking mother’s heart and Edith’s. I’m just a
weak good-for-nothing&mdash;I never shall amount to
anything in the world,” he added, hopelessly.</p>

<p>“Raymond,” said Clark, solemnly, “I believe that
you have come to a turning-point in your life.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
You’ve been going down hill&mdash;you acknowledge it.
Now, if you will, you can turn right about, and go
up. It will be hard at first, I know, but I’ll stand
by you, and Hamlin will too, I’m sure, and when
Gordon and the rest see that you mean to do the
right thing, they’ll back you up too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Stanley, I wish I could. I do so wish I could,”
cried the boy. “But you forget about the drill. Prof.
Keene will find out that I lied to him, and he’ll expel
me&mdash;and mother”&mdash;he broke off, and groaned.</p>

<p>“Ray, if things at school could be made all right
for you, would you really break with Crawford
and that crowd, and try to live down this year’s
doings?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I would, I would so gladly,” cried the boy,
“but it can’t be. It can’t be made right about the
drill.”</p>

<p>“It can in one way, Ray. If you will go to Prof.
Keene and tell him what you have told me, and how
sorry you are for it all, I’m sure he will forgive
you.”</p>

<p>Freeman fairly gasped. “Go to the professor? Oh,
I never could in the world!” he said, “and
Henderson&mdash;he vowed he’d kill me if I told a soul, and
you must never let him know that I’ve told you,
Stanley.”</p>

<p>“Ray, you <em>must</em> go to the professor. He told me
that he was determined to get to the bottom of the<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
affair, and what he sets out to do, he does. He suspects
Henderson, I am sure, and I believe that he
will ferret out the whole business. Then you would
be punished <em>sure</em>; but if you go and confess of your
own accord, it will make all the difference in the
world to him; I am certain of it.”</p>

<p>“But Henderson, Stanley. I’ve no right to tell on
him,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“I think you have, in such a serious business as
this. I think he deserves heavy punishment. But,
Ray, you need not mention his name. You can tell
what you did without implicating anyone else. Oh,
Ray, do it. Your father would tell you to do it, if
he could speak to you.”</p>

<p>Freeman turned his face away, and sat silent for
many minutes. When he spoke again, his voice was
low and firm.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, Stanley,” he said, “but I must do it
right away. Will you come with me?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” and without another word, Clark picked
up the basket and led the way homeward.</p>

<p>An hour later, Professor Keene was informed
that two boys wanted to speak to him, and going
down to his library, found Clark and Freeman
awaiting him there. Clark stayed only until Freeman’s
confession was made; then he quietly left the
room and waited on the sidewalk for his cousin.</p>

<p>It was a long time that he had to wait. Indeed,<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
it was nearly dark before Freeman joined him, and
the two walked on together in a silence that Clark
dared not break and Freeman could not.</p>

<p>“Not going home, Ray?” Clark said, inquiringly,
as his cousin turned another way.</p>

<p>“I must see Mr. Horton before I go home,”
Freeman answered. “I told the professor I would.”</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was quite as much surprised as the
principal had been, when he heard what Freeman
had to say to him; but he, too, was very kind, and
most heartily glad to know that this one, at least, of
his troublesome pupils would henceforth cease to be
a trial in the class-room.</p>

<p>When Freeman left Mr. Horton’s house, he looked
worn and weary, yet there was an expression of
relief&mdash;of peace even, in his pale face. He looked
as if he had laid down a heavy burden that he had
long been bearing; and this, indeed, was just what
he had done.</p>

<p>“Now I can go home,” he said. “But, oh, Stanley,
I can’t be thankful enough that you persuaded
me to own up to it all. You saved me from being
suspended, if not expelled, for Professor Keene and
Mr. Horton had found out all about it.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” exclaimed Clark, in surprise.
“Why, how had they found it out so quickly?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Horton sat where he could see both Henderson
and our fellows in the bleachers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“Queer that the boys didn’t see him,” said Clark,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“His eyes were troubling him, and he wore dark
glasses that day. I suppose that’s why we didn’t
notice him. And, Stanley, he even knew that I
threw the marble that smashed Raleigh’s glasses,
and if I hadn’t acknowledged it to-night, he was
going to call me up before the school next Monday.
So you see, Stanley, I owe it all to you that I am to
be let off so easily.”</p>

<p>“Without punishment, Ray?” questioned Clark.</p>

<p>Freeman’s sensitive face flushed, even in the
darkness, as he answered in a voice that he vainly
tried to steady, “No&mdash;I’ve got to make acknowledgment
before the whole school, and apologize to
Mr. Horton.”</p>

<p>Clark flung his arm affectionately across the boy’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>“It will be a tough job for you, Ray, but I’m sure
you’ll brace up and be a man about it; and if you
do it in manly fashion, no fellow that amounts to
anything will ever cast it up to you again.”</p>

<p>Freeman made no reply, and presently, at his
own gate, he bade his cousin “good-night,” adding
only, “I’ll never forget this day, Stanley.”</p>

<p>Before Freeman slept, he had to tell his story
once more, to his mother and Edith; but he knew
them too well to shrink from their verdict, and he<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
knew, too, that they would but too freely forgive
and forget all his wrong-doing in the gladness of
the assurance that henceforth he would do his best
to make up to them for all that he had made them
suffer.</p>

<p>The interest and excitement over the drill had by
no means died out when the school assembled on
Monday morning. Nothing else was discussed by
the pupils who were there early, and all sorts of
reports as to the punishment of those who had been
guilty of such flagrant misdeeds were current.</p>

<p>Eager eyes watched for the appearance of Henderson
and the members of his company, but when
nine o’clock struck, none of them had been seen,
and Freeman’s seat was also vacant.</p>

<p>Crawford did not appear until the last moment,
and then he dropped into his seat with an evident
desire to avoid notice.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton looked grave and troubled, and his
brief morning prayer was so full of deep feeling
that it impressed even the most careless of his
pupils. As soon as the opening exercises were over,
he told the class to form in line and march to the
hall, and much more silently than usual, and in
perfect order, the boys passed up to the hall, where,
in a few minutes, the whole school was assembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>All the teachers except Professor Keene were on
the platform, and every face was grave and sad.</p>

<p>Never had those nine hundred boys and girls
gathered there on an occasion like this, and never
had such a breathless silence reigned in any of
their gatherings as reigned now during the few
moments while they awaited the appearance of the
principal.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. He came upon the
platform, followed by Freeman and eight of the
members of Company C, but Henderson was not
among them.</p>

<p>Professor Keene’s words to the school were very
brief, but very grave and earnest. Then he turned
to the boys on the platform, and gave them such
a severe reprimand as he had never before given in
public to any of his pupils.</p>

<p>Turning again to the assembled school, he said:
“To perform such a duty as this, is almost as hard
for me as for those whom I am obliged thus publicly
to reprimand, but I am very glad to be able to add
that every one of these schoolmates of yours has made
to me private acknowledgment of his wrong-doing,
and has promised henceforth to do his duty in the
school, and to try, by his conduct in the future, to
efface from all our memories the dishonorable doings
of last week; and similar acknowledgment will
now be made before us all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>As the professor took his seat, Freeman stepped
forward. His face was colorless, and his voice so
low and husky that only those near the platform
could hear him at first. Then he caught sight of
Clark’s face, full of loving sympathy and encouragement.
He seemed to gather strength from that
look, and drawing himself up, he made a frank,
manly apology to his teachers and to the school, and
earnestly declared that it should be his purpose in
the future to do his duty in the school as faithfully
as he possibly could. As he dropped into the
nearest chair, the professor held out his hand, and
said in a low tone, “You did well, Freeman, and I
am sure that you will live up to what you have
promised.”</p>

<p>Baum was the next to speak, and perhaps to no
boy in the school could the ordeal have been more
trying than to him. He was one of the most silent
of boys, never speaking unless spoken to, and then
replying in the fewest possible words. He never
originated any mischief in the school-room, and
would certainly not have done what he did at the
drill, but for his intense and bitter mortification
over his blunder, and Henderson’s angry, scathing
censure before the company. Desperate over all
this, he snatched at the opportunity to redeem himself
in his captain’s estimation, without stopping to
think about the right and wrong of the services required
of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>But in the two days past, he had had time to
think the matter over, and he was sincerely ashamed
now of what he had done. As he stood there facing
the school his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth,
and his heart beat so that he could scarcely breathe,
while the perspiration stood in great drops on his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Go on, Baum,” said the professor, in a low tone,
and the boy burst out, “I don’t know how to speak,
boys, but if I should talk all day, I couldn’t begin
to tell you how I despise myself for what I did,
and for lying about it afterwards. If I ever cut
up so again, hope I may be shot.”</p>

<p>Had the boys dared, they would have given a
hearty cheer for Baum, but they knew better than
to attempt it; but when, feeling sure that he had
made a fool of himself, he dropped into his seat
with flushed face and trembling hands, he had really
risen many degrees in the estimation of his classmates&mdash;though
he would not have believed it had
any one told him so.</p>

<p>The other seven boys made their apologies with
more or less sincerity, and then the classes were
sent to their separate rooms. But the intense feeling
of the morning had unfitted them for study or
recitation, and both teachers and scholars were glad
when the bell gave the signal for recess.</p>

<p>“Say, Gordon, let’s go and speak to Baum. He<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
came out like a man in the hall this morning,” said
Hamlin. “There’s too good stuff in him to be
wasted on that rough crowd he goes with.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was thinking this morning,” said
Gordon, as he followed Hamlin. Baum was leaning
against the fence watching the various groups. He
looked surprised when the two boys approached
him, and when they stopped and spoke to him, his
plain face lighted up with pleasure. To be thus
publicly sought out by the captain and lieutenant
of the prize company was an honor that Baum
knew how to appreciate, and from that hour he
ceased to find pleasure in the companionship of the
Antis, and privately resolved that, if possible, his
name should be on the list of L. A. O.’s next quarter.</p>

<p>“Where’s Freeman?” asked Hamlin, as he and
Gordon joined Clark.</p>

<p>“He’s gone home. Horton told him to. He was
not fit to come to school to-day, anyhow, but he wanted
to be in the hall this morning,” answered Clark.</p>

<p>“He spoke well there,” said Hamlin, “and it must
have been an awful hard thing for him to do.”</p>

<p>“So he did,” said Gordon, “and,” he added, “I
hope that you and he will both join the L. A. O.’s
next fall. We want your help, Clark.”</p>

<p>Clark was so taken by surprise, that for a
moment he could not speak, and in that moment
Gordon and Hamlin passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad you said that, Gordon,” Hamlin said,
as soon as they were out of hearing; “Clark deserves
it, and if the other fellows in the society will only
treat him as they ought, he’ll be glad enough to
join us, I know, and he’ll be a big help, too. There
won’t be more than one meeting of the society this
term, will there?”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” answered Gordon, “and I want to
give all the Antis one more chance to join us. They
are subdued now, and some of them, I think, might
join if we ask them now&mdash;but if we wait till fall,
they will have gotten over all this, and perhaps, be
as bad as ever.”</p>

<p>“I’ve not much faith in Green’s promises,” said
Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Gordon. “He looked to me as if
he apologized to escape being expelled, and not because
he was really sorry for having had a hand in
this business.”</p>

<p>“They say Henderson has cleared out. Have
you heard anything about it, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“I heard so. Somebody said his father was so
furious over his disgrace that he had turned him out
of doors.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a bad business,” said Hamlin, “but
one thing I’m sure of, and that is, that there’ll be a
heap less trouble in section D next year if Henderson
is not here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“I think so, too, though if Crawford is here
there’s sure to be trouble enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he and Green are a bad team. I hope
Freeman will keep away from them now.”</p>

<p>“Clark thinks he will,” said Hamlin.</p>

<p>“I hope he’s right,” replied Gordon; “I believe
there’s good stuff in little Freeman.”</p>

<p>The school year was nearly ended now, and for
the next two weeks written examinations were held
almost every day.</p>

<p>When the last reports were given out, the
L. A. O.’s all stood well, and some had excellent
records. Clark and Gordon each had a hundred for
the quarter, while Henderson and one or two others
were well up in the nineties; but in spite of all this,
the class record was a very poor one.</p>

<p>At the last meeting of the L. A. O.’s, this was the
first subject discussed. Parliamentary methods had
not, as yet, been introduced into these meetings to
any extent, and all the discussions were perfectly
free and informal.</p>

<p>It was Raleigh who began. “I’m about sick of
this old school,” he began gloomily. “Just see how
we’ve worked and dug these last two terms, and, in
spite of it all, section D stands no higher than it did
the first quarter. We’re still at the bottom of the
heap, and still known in the city as the ‘tough section.’
I’ve made up my mind to cut it all next<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
year and go to a private school. My father says
I may.”</p>

<p>“And my father says I must,” said Bates, who
had long since joined the L. A. O.’s. “After the
doings at the drill, he said I shouldn’t come back
here next year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, now, fellows, that’s too mean&mdash;to
back out that way,” said Hamlin. “My father told
me I could go somewhere else, if I wanted to, and I
said, ‘No, sir-e-e! I’m not going to desert the old
Central in that fashion.’ I’m coming back next
year, and I’m going to do my best to make D the
finest section in the school.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Hamlin,” said Gordon’s clear,
quiet voice. “My father was a high school-boy, and
he says that in his time the school stood higher than
any private school in the city, both as to scholarship
and character. I mean to come back next year, and
do all I can to bring the reputation of the school up
to that point again.”</p>

<p>“But we <em>can’t</em> do it,” grumbled Raleigh. “See
how it is now. After all our hard work, a dozen
mean, lazy cubs have spoiled our class record, and,
worse than that, made section D the talk of the
town.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;it has been mighty rough on us this
year,” admitted Gordon; “but, Raleigh, we won’t
have quite so much to fight next year. Henderson<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
won’t be here, and I hope we can win over most of
the Antis, and break up their society altogether.
Freeman, I’m sure, will join us, and I reckon Baum
will, and Ridley. There won’t be so many of the
tough fellows left, and they’ve all had a lesson that
I think they’ll not have forgotten by next fall.”</p>

<p>“Henderson won’t be back, of course,” said
another, “but Crawford will, and Green and Coyle,
I suppose, and they can keep us from making any
decent class record.”</p>

<p>“Crawford has behaved himself since he came
back,” said Hamlin quickly, “and nobody need say
anything against his scholarship now. He came
near a hundred this last report.”</p>

<p>“He does well enough in class,” admitted Raleigh
rather reluctantly, “but he and Henderson have put
the Antis up to all sorts of tricks this last quarter.
They didn’t deserve the marks they got for deportment.”</p>

<p>“I admit all that, Raleigh,” said Gordon, “but, as
I said before, the Antis have had a pretty severe
lesson, and I can’t believe that they’ll dare to do
much to make trouble next year; and they’re most
all bright enough, so, if they <em>do</em> make up their
minds to work&mdash;I mean, if we can any way
arouse their ambition and awaken a feeling of pride
in the section and the school&mdash;we can make a
splendid record without any question.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“Ambition!” echoed Raleigh scornfully. “I’d
like to see Green or Coyle show any pride or ambition
in the school.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will see it. Stranger things
than that have happened,” said Gordon, and Hamlin
added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>I’ve</em> too much pride to be willing to give up the
fight, and let half a dozen mean fellows run the
section and ruin it. I know that both Professor
Keene and Mr. Horton are heartily on our side, and
I’m pretty sure that if Green or Crawford or any of
the rest of that set should undertake to cut up as
they have done this year, they’ll find themselves
bounced without much ceremony, and I do hope
that all you nice fellows will make up your minds
to come back and help us make such a record next
year as the Central has never had yet.”</p>

<p>“We never could beat A section, no matter how
hard we might work,” said one.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Don’t you believe it,” replied Hamlin.
“<em>I’m</em> not going to admit that a girl’s section can go
ahead of us, if we really set out to win.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see they’ve got first rank, and it’s a
sight easier for them to hold it than for us to win it
away from them,” said Reed. “Possession is nine
points of the law, you know.”</p>

<p>“There spoke our future chief justice,” laughed
Hamlin, for Reed’s predilection for the study of the<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
law was well known. “But the girls of section A
will find themselves ousted from their possession of
first rank in the Central next year, or I miss my
guess.”</p>

<p>When this last meeting of the L. A. O.’s adjourned,
Gordon and Hamlin felt pretty well assured
that all the members except Bates would return in
the fall, and they discussed between themselves
many and various plans for the enlargement and
improvement of the society the coming year.</p>

<p>The graduating class was so large that it was impossible
for the members of it to take part in the
commencement exercises. Once or twice in recent
years, one member had been selected to deliver an
oration, or in some other way to represent the class,
but it was a difficult matter to select one from
among so many without awakening much hard feeling,
and so now the class took no part in the exercises
except to sit on the platform and receive their
diplomas from the hand of some distinguished man
who had been invited to honor the occasion. This
distinguished gentleman, or some other, was also
asked to address the graduates, and such was the
program on this year.</p>

<p>But, as the two schools numbered over twelve
hundred, they and the friends and relatives of the
graduates made a very large assemblage, so that the
exercises were always held in one of the great opera
houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>As our boys in section D were to be themselves
among the graduates the next year, they were all
present on this occasion, it being to them in the nature
of a rehearsal.</p>

<p>The girls in their white dresses and ribbons, with
the beautiful flowers they carried, made a pretty picture
on the platform; but this time, our boys were
more interested in the other portion of the graduating
class. They watched the boys as they went
forward to receive their diplomas, and wondered if
they themselves would be able to make as graceful
a bow as some did, or if they should be as stiff and
awkward as other poor fellows who became sadly
embarrassed when they found themselves in such a
conspicuous position.</p>

<p>“Now for a good time,” said Hamlin, as he left the
opera house when the exercises were over. “Where
are you going to spend the vacation, Clark?”</p>

<p>“Right here,” said Clark.</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the other. “That’s too bad,
Clark. You need a rest, and it’s awful hot here in
summer.”</p>

<p>“Expect it is,” replied Clark, “but I’ve no choice,
Hamlin. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Up in the mountains. We have a summer cottage
in the Catskills. I wish you’d go up with me
for two or three weeks, Clark&mdash;can’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t possibly, Hamlin, though it’s awfully<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
good of you to ask me,” Clark replied. “But I hope
you’ll have a grand time, and come home in prime
condition for work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to,” laughed the other, “and don’t you
forget that we count on you as an L. A. O. next
year,” and with a friendly hand-grasp, he said, “good-bye,”
and ran to overtake Gordon.</p>

<p>A day or two later, the doors of the Central high
school were closed, and the boys and girls gathered
there no more, but some at the seashore, and some
in the mountains, they sought rest and pleasure,
while many others&mdash;unable to leave the city, soon
found themselves looking forward to September,
when they might take up again the school duties
that, after all, have so much that is bright and
pleasant, mingled with the hard and tiresome round.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NEW PUPILS IN SECTION D.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>School reopened the second Monday in September,
and long before nine o’clock the boys and girls
began to gather about the steps, waiting for the janitor
to open the doors.</p>

<p>Hamlin had overtaken Clark and Freeman, and
when the three reached the schoolhouse gate they
found a goodly number there before them, and many
voices called out greetings, especially to Hamlin.</p>

<p>“There’s a newcomer,” Clark said; “up there near
the door.”</p>

<p>“The chap with the rosy locks?” answered Hamlin.
“Yes, he’s new, but he seems to be making
himself very much at home. He’s talking away
with the old fellows as if he had known them all
his life. There! Jimmy’s opening the doors. Let’s
wait here a bit. I don’t care to hustle through that
crowd.”</p>

<p>“Evidently, he of the rosy locks doesn’t either,”
remarked Clark, noticing that the red-haired boy
had not passed in with the throng, but remained on
the upper step with two or three other boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>“Look at him, will you! Well, if he isn’t a cheeky
cad!” exclaimed Hamlin a moment later, as the boy
they were watching pulled off his hat and made a
low bow to a group of girls passing to the other
door. Among these girls was Gordon’s sister, and
Grace Harlan, a cousin of Hamlin’s.</p>

<p>“I’d like to punch his head for him. He doesn’t
know those girls&mdash;not one of them spoke to him,”
Hamlin added.</p>

<p>“Wonder if he’ll be in our section,” said Clark, as
the three boys passed up the steps.</p>

<p>“Hope not,” replied Hamlin. “We don’t want
any of his sort in section D.”</p>

<p>A shout of welcome met them as they entered
their own class-room, and Clark felt happier than he
had ever felt before in that school-room as one and
another called out a friendly greeting. Several took
pains to speak to Freeman, whose sensitive face
showed his appreciation of the kindness.</p>

<p>“Wonder if Green isn’t coming back,” said Gordon,
noticing his vacant seat.</p>

<p>“No,” volunteered Coyle, “he’s gone to work.”</p>

<p>Gordon and Hamlin exchanged glances of satisfaction
at this information, and both thought, “One
less of the Antis.”</p>

<p>Green had been one of the most disagreeable boys
in the class, and very few felt sorry that he would
come among them no more. Several other seats<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
were vacant, but only one of the L. A. O.’s had failed
to return. That one was Bates, who had gone to
boarding-school.</p>

<p>Soon after the opening exercises were over, Prof
Keene appeared with four new boys, and Hamlin
threw a doleful glance at Clark, for the first of the
new-comers was the red-headed boy whom they had
seen on the steps. The second was a tall, handsome
lad of perhaps seventeen, and the other two were
ordinary looking boys of ordinary ability, not destined
to have much influence one way or the other
on the standing of section D.</p>

<p>Of course the school could not get into smooth
running order that first day, and the recess was prolonged
to nearly twice its usual length. A group of
the L. A. O.’s quickly got together in a corner of the
playground, and, as Hamlin, Gordon, Raleigh and
Sherman were among the number, the talk soon
drifted to the subjects dear to all their hearts&mdash;the
L. A. O. and the standing of D section.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” Hamlin began, “with Green and
Henderson gone, seems to me we might get the few
Antis left to join us now. If they’d only do their
best, we could easily put old section D at the top
this year.”</p>

<p>“There’s Crawford left&mdash;and Coyle,” remarked
one, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Coyle’s a bad lot, I know, but he’s only one; and<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
somehow, I’ve a notion that Crawford has come back
with different ideas, this term,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what makes you think that?” questioned
Raleigh.</p>

<p>“I don’t know really,” answered Gordon, thoughtfully,
“only somehow there’s a different air about
him. There he is over there, now.”</p>

<p>Every eye in the group followed Gordon’s glance
to where Crawford stood leaning against the fence.
There was no one near him, and something in his
attitude, and in the expression of his face, convinced
more than one of the boys that Gordon was right,
and that Crawford was changed somehow.</p>

<p>“Suppose there’d be any use in asking him to join
the L. A. O.?” questioned Sherman, after a moment’s
silence.</p>

<p>“I should say ask him, by all means. He can’t do
more than refuse,” said Gordon; “and we must ask
the new fellows, of course. Hamlin, will you interview
Rosy or the black-eyed chap?”</p>

<p>“Neither. I’ll take the other two fellows,” said
Hamlin, promptly.</p>

<p>“All right, then I’ll see to the black-eyed fellow;
and Sherman, you might interview Rosy. I’m going
to speak to Crawford, now.”</p>

<p>Crawford looked greatly surprised as Gordon approached,
and yet more surprised when the latter
made known his errand. He dropped his eyes, the<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
color mounted in his dark cheeks, and for a moment
he was silent. Then he looked Gordon full in the
face and said slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you really want me, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do, or I would not have asked you,”
was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>“And the other fellows?” questioned Crawford.</p>

<p>“I think we shall all be glad to have you join us,
Crawford,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Gordon&mdash;I don’t suppose you know what it is
to be ashamed of yourself through and through. I
do&mdash;and I don’t enjoy the feeling.” There was a
ring of pain in Crawford’s voice as he spoke, and
Gordon could not question his sincerity. He held
out his hand saying, heartily:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The best of us go wrong so often that we can’t
afford to be hard on anybody who is honestly sorry,
Crawford. I want you on our side this year to help
us make the old Central proud of section D.”</p>

<p>Crawford grasped the offered hand and then turned
away without another word, but Gordon felt that the
look on his face was more eloquent than any words
could have been.</p>

<p>When he went back to the group in the corner
and reported his success, some of the boys looked
doubtful. They found it hard yet to believe that
Crawford was in earnest, but at least they were glad
to be able to hope that he would no longer lead the
idle and troublesome element into fresh mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>“If Coyle could only be gotten rid of, now,” remarked
Raleigh, “we might hope to make a fine
record this year, so far as deportment goes. It remains
to be seen what kind of students these new
fellows are.”</p>

<p>“That black-eyed chap looks as if he had brains,”
remarked Reed.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if he thought he had the monopoly
of brains,” put in Hamlin.</p>

<p>“He does have rather a high and mighty air,” said
Sherman. “May be only shyness, though. Some fellows
put on airs like that when their hearts are in
their boots.”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> isn’t troubled with shyness&mdash;anything but,”
retorted Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Neither is Rosy, for that matter,” remarked Clark
laughingly.</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Clark,” said Hamlin; “but
there goes the bell. Say, Gordon,” he added, as
they moved towards the door, “can’t we have a
meeting of the L. A. O. to-morrow, to let these new
fellows get an idea of what we want to do this year?”</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Gordon, “we’ll say after
school to-morrow, then.”</p>

<p>When, the next day, Gordon called the meeting
to order, his face beamed with satisfaction as he
looked around and saw that almost the entire section
was present. The only exceptions were Coyle,<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Barber, one of his special friends, and the black-eyed
boy whom Gordon was to have invited to join them.</p>

<p>This was the first of these meetings at which
Clark, Freeman or Crawford had been present, but
certainly no one in the room was more interested
than these three, who for such different reasons had
hitherto been absent.</p>

<p>Gordon was usually very quiet and rather reserved,
but he was very fond of the Central high school, as
his father had been before him, and he had come
back full of the desire that it should stand as high, if
not higher, this year, than in the old days when his
father was so proud of its reputation. So, to-day,
he was so eager and so full of enthusiastic plans for
raising the standard of the class, and gaining for it
first rank in the school, that before long the other
members of the L. A. O. caught something of his
spirit, and all sorts of plans and propositions were
made. It was unanimously resolved that every
member should do his very best in class, and that
not even the drill or ball games should be allowed
to interfere with the great object.</p>

<p>Three of the new boys were present at this meeting,
but only Dixon, or “Rosy,” as he was already
dubbed in the class, made any remarks. He was
on his feet half a dozen times, asking questions,
making suggestions, or offering amendments.</p>

<p>When the meeting was over, and all but Gordon<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
and Hamlin had left the room, the latter threw
himself into a seat exclaiming, “Well, I reckon
we’ll get enough of that Rosy before the year is
ended! He’s of a retiring disposition, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Gordon laughed. “He won’t have so many questions
to ask next time,” he said.</p>

<p>“Won’t? Don’t you believe it. He’ll <em>always</em> have
a raft of ’em to reel off. He <em>may</em> be a very nice
chap, but deliver me from having anything to do
with any more of the sort. But how about his
royal highness with the black eyes? Wouldn’t he
condescend to accept the invitation?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gordon quietly, though his face
flushed at the question.</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Gordon, you might as well out with
it. Your face gives you away. What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Gordon with a half laugh, “he drew
himself up and looked at me as if I were a toad or a
snake, and remarked that he had come here to study&mdash;not
to fool away his time in clubs or any such
nonsense, and that he would thank me to leave him
alone.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Hamlin, “he’ll be pretty popular
here, won’t he?” Then he added, indignantly,
“Well, if he <em>isn’t</em> a cool customer! I reckon he’ll
<em>be</em> let alone emphatically, hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gordon, “but there’s one good thing.
If he’s a fine scholar, and I fancy that he is, he’ll<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
help the section that way, in spite of himself; and
certainly, that sort of a fellow won’t be cutting up
or getting others into mischief, so he won’t work
<em>against</em> the L. A. O.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Hamlin; “but what a
chump he is to take such a stand as that, and lose
all the good times he might have here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Gordon, “but see here, Hamlin,
let’s not tell the other fellows anything about this.
It would turn them all against him, and I don’t
think he’s likely to make many friends anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Evidently he does not care to make any,” said
Hamlin.</p>

<p>“It seems not, but you know if the fellows get
set against him, some of them will do their best to
make it hot for him. You and I don’t want to have
any hand in that sort of thing, so we’ll keep mum
about this&mdash;shan’t we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so,” grumbled Hamlin. “I feel as
if I’d like to kick him myself, and I reckon most of
the boys would feel the same way. We’ll let his
royal highness severely alone, since that’s his pleasure.
By the way, what <em>is</em> his name, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Somebody said it was Everett St. John. Perhaps
it’s on the strength of his aristocratic name
that he puts on so many airs,” replied Gordon.</p>

<p>On the outer steps a group of boys stood talking
and laughing&mdash;among them, Rosy. He stepped<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
forward, and slipped his arm familiarly through
Hamlin’s, as the latter came down the stairs with
Gordon.</p>

<p>“I say, Hamlin,” he began, not in the least disconcerted
at Hamlin’s straightening out his arm
like a poker, “I wish you’d introduce me to Grace
Harlan. She’s a cousin of yours, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“<em>Miss</em> Harlan is my cousin,” answered Hamlin
coldly, “but I never introduce boys to her except at
her own request.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, Rosy&mdash;got squelched that time,” snickered
Coyle, as Hamlin and Gordon passed on.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing. I’ll get somebody else to introduce
me. <em>Miss</em> Harlan is the prettiest girl I’ve
seen in an age,” responded Rosy serenely, while
Hamlin was growling in Gordon’s ear, “Introduce
him to Grace, indeed! I think I see myself doing
it.”</p>

<p>Being a little late next morning, Hamlin took a
short cut to school, passing through a side street
where he seldom went. He was going along at a
rapid pace when he saw Dixon come out of a door
half-way down the block. When Hamlin reached
the place he glanced up at the still open door. It
was a low saloon.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” he thought, “I wish that fellow had
never come near the Central. It was bad enough
before, but now that I know that he goes into such<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
holes as that&mdash;what am I to do about it? He’ll
probably get other fellows in there, too. Wonder if
I ought to tell Bobby.”</p>

<p>But to “tell on a fellow,” even in a case like
this, was very repugnant to Hamlin.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it yet a while,” he decided, “but I’ll
keep a sharp eye on him, and if I ever see him in
such a place again, I’ll warn him that I’ll report
him unless he stops it.”</p>

<p>Dixon was standing by the school gate, and
greeted Hamlin with the utmost cordiality, seeming
not to notice the coldness with which the other responded.
It was impossible to freeze Dixon&mdash;he
simply would not be frozen.</p>

<p>On this morning the regular recitations were to
begin, and Gordon, Clark and Hamlin were eager to
hear the new boys recite, that they might judge
whether they would be helps or hindrances in that
which our boys were so anxious to accomplish this
year&mdash;to make D the banner section of the school.</p>

<p>They knew that two other sections, at least, were
as eager and as determined as they to hold the first
place, and one or two poor scholars might bring the
record down in spite of all that could be done by
others in the class. So eyes and ears were alert
that morning in section D.</p>

<p>The first recitation was that of the Latin class.
Clark had easily held first rank in this, though<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
Hamlin, Gordon and Sherman were all excellent
scholars. The lesson this morning was from Virgil,
and according to the usual custom, the class was
seated, each boy standing only during his own recitation.</p>

<p>“Reed, you may begin,” Mr. Horton said, “and
when you have read five lines, the next may continue.”</p>

<p>One after another, the boys rendered the lines,
and, though some had blundered, nobody had failed
when it came to Clark. Clark never had been
known to fail in Latin translation. The others
attended to his recitation only because it was sure
to be better than their own; but to-day they wanted
him to get through so that they might listen to
Everett St. John, who was the next in order.</p>

<p>The lesson was from Virgil, and Clark’s lines
ended with the words of Æneas, which he translated
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By its own fortune, a tempest drove us, carried
over different waters, to the Libyan shores&mdash;if by
chance, the name of Troy has come through your
ears. I am the pious Æneas, known by fame above
the air, who carry with me in my ship the Penates
torn from the enemy. I seek Italy, my country, and
a race from greatest Jove.”</p>

<p>As Clark took his seat, St. John rose and said
coolly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Those last lines were very roughly rendered,
Mr. Horton. It is much better this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A tempest, by its own chance, drove us, borne
from ancient Troy (if, perchance, the name of Troy
has reached your ears), over various waters, to the
African shores. I am the pious Æneas, known by
fame above the sky, who bear with me, in my fleet,
the Penates snatched from the foe. I seek Italy,
my fatherland, and an ancestry that sprang from
sovereign Jove.”</p>

<p>Then, without noticing in the least the astonished
and indignant glances of the boys, who resented the
criticism on Clark, not so much because it was
Clark, but because it was the finest Latin scholar in
the class, St. John proceeded with his own five
lines, translating not only very correctly, but into
choice and elegant English.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton’s face expressed his satisfaction at
such an acquisition to the classical department. He
even forgot the rudeness shown to Clark, who had
come to be one of his favorite pupils, so greatly did
he enjoy the thought of teaching such a scholar, and
he turned with a sigh to the next boy, whose lame,
halting sentences formed so great a contrast to St.
John’s.</p>

<p>Nobody except the one reciting paid much attention
then, until Dixon arose. It was impossible to
ignore Dixon anywhere. Already he had succeeded<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
in making both friends and enemies, and
now the eyes of all the class were fixed on him.</p>

<p>“Good!” thought Gordon, as Dixon read smoothly
on. “He won’t pull us down, and if St. John’s as
good in other things as he is in Latin, he’ll help us
up in spite of himself. Guess he’ll go ahead of
Clark. I’m sorry for Clark, though.”</p>

<p>And much the same thoughts were in the minds
of many of the boys when the recitation was over.
Slowly, but surely, the feeling that had been so
strong against Clark was dying out. Some few of
the boys still stood aloof from him, however, and
recalled, at intervals, the charges made against him
early in the previous year. But Hamlin’s strong
friendship for him, and his own quiet, steady doing
of his duty, and holding himself apart, yet without
any show of enmity or ill-feeling, had had their
effect upon his schoolmates, and most of them were
ready now to be friends with him; while all,
whether friends or not, were proud of his scholarship,
and had come to look upon him as the leader
of the class in that line. So they were inclined to
resent St. John’s arrogant assumption of superiority,
and to wish that Clark could “dig in and get ahead
of him,” as Reed expressed it.</p>

<p>In mathematics it was much the same, though
here Hamlin and Gordon stood almost as high as
Clark; would have stood quite as high, if they had<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
had Clark’s power of concentration and application.</p>

<p>“I’ve <em>had</em> to learn how to study,” he had said
once to Hamlin. “If you and Gordon had been
obliged to do it, as I have, I shouldn’t be a bit
ahead of you.”</p>

<p>With Everett St. John, it was not necessity, but
the instinct of a born student that gave him the
power to grasp and master whatever he studied. In
the geometry class, his clear, concise demonstrations
awakened at once the despair and the admiration
of most of the class, while they aroused in our
three boys an eager determination to work as they
never had worked before over those lines and
angles.</p>

<p>Gordon drew a long breath, as he joined Clark
and Hamlin at recess.</p>

<p>“Well, one thing is certain, and that is that St.
John is bound to help our record, if he keeps on as
he has begun,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, and carry off all the prizes, too,” grumbled
Hamlin.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Freeman, who was standing by.
He spoke sadly, for his only chance of a college
education lay in his gaining one of the scholarships
offered as prizes to the senior class.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Hamlin, “he may win all the
scholarships, but he certainly can go to but one<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
college, so somebody else is bound to have a
chance.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Clark, “I heard last
evening that two new scholarships had been offered.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“One to Lehigh, and one to Jamestown College, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Hamlin. “That makes six scholarships,
and if his royal highness&mdash;Mr. Everett St.
John&mdash;<em>should</em> come out No. 1, as likely as not he
would not go to any college that offers us a scholarship.
He’s so high and mighty that he’d probably
go only to the toniest and most expensive college in
the country.”</p>

<p>“Rosy came out pretty well, too,” said Reed.</p>

<p>“Yes, better than I thought he would,” said Gordon.
“Anyway, I’m glad that neither of ’em is
likely to pull us down. I believe old section D has
a fair chance to come out No. 1 this year.”</p>

<p>“Certainly looks like it,” responded Hamlin,
“and nobody has worked harder to bring it about
than you have, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad that Raleigh concluded to come
back this year,” was all Gordon answered.</p>

<p>For several weeks things went smoothly in section
D. Mr. Horton was delighted, for a more
orderly class-room could not be desired. Once in a<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
while, Coyle and Barber would try to start some
mischief, but they were in far too great a minority
for anything of that sort to prosper. By the first of
November, they and St. John were the only members
of the class who were not also members of the
L. A. O.; and to be a member of the L. A. O. this
year meant to be not only pledged to use all one’s
influence for good order in the class-room and
gentlemanly deportment in all places and at all
times, but it also meant now to be fully determined
that no effort should be spared on the part of each
member to place section D at the head of the old
Central.</p>

<p>In short, Gordon and Hamlin had succeeded in
imparting their enthusiasm, in greater or less degree,
to every boy in the class with the exception of
the three mentioned; and this enthusiasm received
fresh impetus at the weekly meetings of the L. A. O.</p>

<p>Besides, the duller boys of the class were continually
watched and helped by the class leaders, and
helped in such friendly fashion, and so thoroughly,
that their pride was not hurt, and a healthy ambition
to help themselves was being awakened in them.</p>

<p>Decidedly the most unpopular boy in the class
was Everett St. John, but this fact troubled him not
at all. So long as his schoolmates let him alone, he
cared not the least what they thought of him, and
they <em>did</em> let him severely alone, for, after a week or<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
two no one ever spoke to him. Those who had ventured
to do so had been met so coldly, not to say
rudely, that they had no desire to repeat the experience.
But however much they might dislike him,
they could not fail to appreciate and admire his
ability. Never before had section D had such fine
recitations as St. John’s in Latin and English literature.</p>

<p>The inevitable result was that those who had
stood highest in the class heretofore were stimulated
to fresh effort, and soon found themselves
doing much better work than they had supposed
themselves capable of doing&mdash;to Mr. Horton’s great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Nor was the spirit of ambition limited to section
D. It spread to other sections, and other teachers
began to be encouraged by increased application, and
consequently, better recitations in their classes.</p>

<p>It was a singular fact, that this most unusual improvement
in the spirit of the school should have
been so largely due to a new scholar who cared
nothing whatever about the school, and was solely
interested in himself and his own work; but so it
was.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHO SHALL BE CAPTAIN OF COMPANY C?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In October, there came a sudden stir of interest
and excitement of a different sort, namely, the appointment
of Henderson’s successor in the battalion.</p>

<p>Gordon was now major, and Hamlin had taken
his place as captain of Company C.</p>

<p>The appointments had heretofore been made by
Prof. Keene, and the liveliest interest was awakened
when he announced that, this time, the captain was
to be elected by vote of the officers of the battalion
and all the members of Company C.</p>

<p>No one was eligible for the captaincy except those
members of the senior class whose average during
the previous years had been ninety or more, and of
these there were but eight, and of these, two&mdash;one
of whom was Clark&mdash;had not been in the battalion
at all, and so of course could not be candidates.
The names of the remaining six were put on the
bulletin board, and Prof. Keene announced that the
vote would be taken after school on Friday of that
week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>Graham and Raleigh stood highest on the list,
each having averaged ninety-four for the previous
years. Then came Griffin, the first lieutenant of
Company C, with an average of ninety-two; then
Fry, Cole and Edson, with averages of ninety-one
and ninety. The last three belonged to another section.</p>

<p>Prof. Keene had supposed that the choice would
lie between Graham and Raleigh, and as he was
perfectly willing that either should hold the position,
he had decided that the one that the boys preferred
should be captain. He had not imagined that
any one of the other four would be considered at all,
and was wholly unprepared for the strong feeling
and sharp rivalry that was soon developed. Neither
was he fully aware of the character of some of the
boys in Company C. There were a few fine fellows
in the company, but there were more who were idle
and indifferent to everything but “fun,” and a few
who were really bad, and who would not hesitate to
sacrifice the best interests of the school to carry out
their own schemes. Some of these last had been
friends of Henderson, and these had by no means
forgotten the occurrences at the competitive drill.
They resented Henderson’s enforced departure, and
the disgrace that had fallen upon the company
rankled in their minds. To these, the idea of having
Graham or Raleigh for a captain was most distasteful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>Coyle was second lieutenant of Company C, and
he and Barber, who belonged to another company,
quickly made up their minds that, if possible, these
two should be defeated on Friday.</p>

<p>Monday was “drill day,” and when the drill was
over, Coyle privately asked all of Company C except
the first lieutenant, who was a particular friend of
Graham’s, to stop and talk the matter over. The
discussion was held with closed doors, and a lively
one it was.</p>

<p>Coyle was the first speaker.</p>

<p>“I say, fellows,” he began, eagerly, “we’ve got a
chance now to choose our captain, and I move that
we boom Griffin. I, for one, don’t want any such
prig as Graham or Raleigh put over us. Griffin
here is worth a dozen such chaps.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on Griffin as Coyle sat down,
and somebody called, “Speech, speech.”</p>

<p>“I’m not much of a speechifier,” said Griffin, rising,
“but I appreciate the honor you have done me, and
if I’m elected, I’ll do my best to help you win the
red ribbons next June.”</p>

<p>Then Barber sprang up.</p>

<p>“Griffin hasn’t got quite such high marks as those
other fellows,” he said, “but he’s no end better up
in tactics, and I’d rather have him for captain if he
wasn’t.”</p>

<p>Coyle started vigorous applause at this, but now
another spoke up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t a thing to say against Griffin,” he began.
“He’s well up in the drill, and understands
the duties of a captain; but the same is true of Graham,
and I’m sure that most of the officers will vote
for him. I don’t believe we could elect Griffin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! We can elect him if we all hang
together,” cried Coyle, springing to his feet again.
“Now see here&mdash;there are twenty-two officers, and
in Company C there are forty men. Now if the
company will go solid for Griffin, even without a
vote from a single officer, we shall elect him by a
big majority.”</p>

<p>Carr, a boy with a quiet, resolute face, now rose
and said quietly, “I shall vote for Graham, because
I believe that he can do more for Company C than
any other on the list.”</p>

<p>Barber hissed then; whereupon another boy
sprang up and cried, “I move that any fellow that
hisses be put out. If we can’t discuss this matter
like gentlemen, we’d better adjourn right now.
Every fellow here has a right to his own opinion, I
take it&mdash;and I’ve just as much right to vote for
Graham as Barber has to vote for Griffin, and I intend
to do it.”</p>

<p>Barber, seeing that the tide of feeling was with
the last speaker, jumped up, and, with a good-natured
laugh, exclaimed, “Don’t lay that little hiss up
against me, boys. It was only a whistle that slipped
up on my front teeth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>The laugh that followed scored one for Barber
and the candidate that he favored.</p>

<p>But Coyle’s quick eyes had been watching the
faces of the boys, and now he sprang up again.</p>

<p>“It’s getting late,” he said, “and I move that we
adjourn, and meet again Wednesday after drill.
That will give us all time to think the matter over,
and make up our minds whom we’ll vote for. But
see here,” as a general movement expressed the approval
of the motion to adjourn, “don’t forget that
Griffin stands A No. 1 in tactics, and we all want
to win the gold medal and red ribbons next June.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Coyle and Griffin,” shouted
somebody, and in two minutes the room was empty;
but as the boys hurried homeward, the talk was all
about the election.</p>

<p>Coyle and Barber were the last to leave the room.</p>

<p>“I’d like to punch the heads of some of those fellows,”
growled Coyle. “If the company would only
go solid for Griffin, it wouldn’t matter how the officers
voted.”</p>

<p>“No, we’d have nearly two-thirds majority,”
answered Barber, “and I’d give something to see
Graham and Raleigh defeated. I believe I care
more for that than to put Griffin in. They’re all
so mighty high and tony in section D this year, a
fellow can’t have a bit of fun. Might as well be in
a reform school, and done with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“Right you are,” responded Coyle. “Gordon and
Hamlin have managed somehow to get hold of about
all the section except you and me, and they’ve set
’em all to digging. Not much like last year, is it?
Who’d ever have believed that Crawford would go
over to the L. A. O.! He’s as meek as Moses now-a-days.”</p>

<p>“So he is,” echoed Barber, “an’ if we have Graham
or Raleigh for captain, the drill will be as bad
as the school-room. They’ll make the fellows toe
the mark and be down on ’em like sixty for the
least thing wrong.”</p>

<p>“We <em>just won’t have</em> Graham or Raleigh,” cried
Coyle, positively. “You and I must see the fellows
we’re sure of before to-morrow night, and find some
way of putting Griffin in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we’re going to do it, if some of
the company vote for Graham, and you see they
will, from what they said to-day,” replied Barber.</p>

<p>“I see that they mean to now,” said Coyle, “but
it does not follow that they will be of the same
mind next Friday. It’s our business to make ’em
change their minds. Now go home and think hard,
Barber, and I’ll set my wits to work, and see if we
can’t fix up some plan that will win the day for ‘we,
us and Company’ C,” said Coyle, as he stopped at
his own home.</p>

<p>Usually Coyle was asleep two minutes after his<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
head touched his pillow, but that night he lay
awake more than an hour or two, his thoughts busy
with plots and plans to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>He was at Barber’s door soon after eight o’clock
next morning, and that young gentleman, swallowing
the last of his breakfast with most unhealthy
rapidity, joined him in response to his impatient
whistle.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of a way to spike Graham’s guns,”
Coyle began, and while his companion listened with
eager interest, he proceeded to unfold his scheme.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” Barber exclaimed, slapping Coyle on
the shoulder, as the latter ceased speaking. “I’m
sure our crowd will catch on to that little game, and
I believe we can rope in most of the Grahamites
without much trouble.”</p>

<p>Coyle looked pleased at the other’s hearty approval.</p>

<p>“You and I must let the fellows we’re sure of
into our scheme, and then we’ll tell the doubtful
ones enough to secure their votes, and no more,” he
said.</p>

<p>Before school, at recess, and after school that
day, Coyle and Barber were busy boys. Barber
gathered in a corner of the playground, at recess, all
the members of Company C whom he knew to be
strongly in favor of Griffin, and to them unfolded
Coyle’s plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>Meantime, Coyle joined another group of the
members of Company C. After listening for a few
minutes, to what one and another had to say, he remarked
casually, “I’ve been thinking it over, and
I’d about made up my mind to let Griffin go, and
vote for Graham. He’s a prime fellow if he is a
little too stiff&mdash;but something I heard this morning
made me rather inclined to stick to Griffin.”</p>

<p>“What was it you heard?” questioned several of
the group.</p>

<p>“Why, that Gordon and Hamlin are working for
all they are worth, to get self-government into the
battalion.”</p>

<p>“Self-government? What do you mean by that?”
queried one, while all listened for the reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know how they manage in some of
the military schools? The boys elect a judge and
jury from their own number, and if any boy does
anything contrary to rules, they try him and pronounce
sentence themselves, subject of course to
the principal’s approval.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with that? We’d have
it all in our own hands, and we could make our
punishments as light as we pleased,” laughed one.</p>

<p>“Not much&mdash;if Graham or Raleigh was captain,
and Gordon judge, as he would be. Those fellows
are both right under Gordon’s thumb, and he thinks
it’s a sin to smile in school hours. He’s crazy on<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
the subject of the reputation of the Central, and he’s
got every fellow in our section, except Barber and
me&mdash;and his royal highness, St. John&mdash;to work
for honors. You can see how it will be if his candidate,
Graham, is elected&mdash;no more jolly times for
Company C. All but three or four of the officers
are ready to back Gordon and Hamlin, whatever
they propose, and if they put their self-government
scheme through, we fellows in Company C, that like
a bit of fun now and then, won’t have any show at
all. Cigarette smoking will be a capital crime, and
if a fellow happens to say ‘by ginger’ he’ll be in
disgrace for a month. <em>We’ll</em> get no favors&mdash;you’ll
see. It will be the fellows that dig into Latin and
geometry day and night, that will be favored, and
those of us that like to see a little of life and have a
good time now and then, will get sat upon every
time.”</p>

<p>“But are you sure that Graham favors this self-government
scheme, Coyle?” questioned one.</p>

<p>“Heard Graham himself say to Hamlin that if he
was elected, that’s the thing he’d work for&mdash;another
form of the L. A. O. they’re so proud of in our
section,” replied Coyle.</p>

<p>“If that’s so, I’m inclined not to vote for Graham.
How about Raleigh? Is he of the same mind?”
questioned another.</p>

<p>“Like as two peas in a pod,” replied Coyle,
promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll vote for Griffin. He’s as good
in the drill as either of the others, and who cares
for two or three credits less in his average?” said a
third.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> for his average,” cried another, snapping
his fingers. “This is our last year in the old battalion,
and I’d rather Company C would carry off the
prizes in the next annual drill than to come out
number one in the school myself.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Coyle, “You know Griffin can’t be
beat as a drill-master, and he’s a jolly good fellow
besides, and not the one to be always snooping
around to see if a man happens to have a cigarette
or a pack of cards in his pocket. We don’t want a
straight-laced parson like Graham put over Company
C. Why not all vote for Griffin and done with it?
I think it would be fine, anyhow, to carry the
election against Gordon’s candidate. Gordon thinks
he’s a bigger man than Professor Keene himself, and
it would take him down a peg or two to see Griffin
put in place of his shadow, Alec Graham.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be a good joke on Gordon, wouldn’t it!”
remarked one.</p>

<p>“Make him open his eyes a little.”</p>

<p>“And show him that somebody else in the school
besides himself has a little influence,” added Coyle,
cunningly fanning the flame that he saw he had
kindled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>Before the bell rang, all in the group had agreed
to vote for Griffin. This made thirty so pledged,
besides Griffin himself, Coyle and Barber, and one of
the other captains, thirty-four in all, which would
give Griffin the majority. Coyle and Barber were
outwardly quiet, but inwardly jubilant.</p>

<p>The next morning, Coyle went to school with a
new suggestion, over which he and Barber chuckled
delightedly before they talked it over with the
Griffin faction.</p>

<p>After drill that day, a meeting was held to talk
over the election, the officers being anxious to get
an idea of what the boys of Company C meant to
do. Their surprise was unbounded when Coyle
announced that he could speak for thirty-three who
would vote for Graham.</p>

<p>“For <em>Graham</em>,” repeated Hamlin, incredulously,
“Why, that’s fine. Looks as if Graham would have
a unanimous vote.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m going to vote for Raleigh,” cried one,
and three or four others shouted, “So am I.”</p>

<p>But at this Raleigh, who was the only one of the
candidates present, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully obliged to you,” he cried, “but I
came in just on purpose to say that I’d rather
remain lieutenant of Company D; honest, I would.
I fit in there pretty well, I believe, and I’m not sure
that I’d make a good captain; and anyhow, I’ve made<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
up my mind to have my name withdrawn, and I do
hope that those of you who would have voted for
me, will vote for Graham as I’m going to do. I’d
be just <em>pleased</em> to have a unanimous vote for him.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Lieutenant Raleigh,” shouted
one of his friends, as Raleigh, very red in the face,
dropped into his seat.</p>

<p>Then Gordon arose. “You see how it is,” he said;
“Raleigh absolutely refuses to be a candidate for
promotion, and the matter seems to rest between
Graham and Griffin; or at least, I supposed it did,
until Coyle made his statement just now. I think
with Raleigh, that it would be fine to have a unanimous
vote for Graham. He would be sure then
that he would have the support of Company C, and
I know how much it means to a captain to feel that
his men are all friendly, and ready to back him up
in whatever he plans for the good of his company.”</p>

<p>Here Coyle winked at Barber, and scowls and
grins were noticeable among Griffin’s friends.
Hamlin’s quick eyes noted this little by-play, and a
vague feeling of distrust and uncertainty began to
trouble him. He sprang up and said, “You all
know, I am sure, that it is because the school has
taken a higher stand this year, that Professor Keene
decided to let us choose the captain of Company C,
and he’s sure to be satisfied if we elect Graham, for
you all know that we haven’t a finer all-around<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
fellow in the school. For myself, I’ve only one
objection to him as captain of Company C, and that
is, that I’m awfully afraid that, under his training,
you will be so perfect in drill that you’ll get the red
ribbons away from Company D next June.”</p>

<p>“You bet we mean to,” shouted a coarse voice
from Company C, as Hamlin sat down, and there
was something in the rude tone that stirred the
anger of more than one of Graham’s friends.</p>

<p>When the meeting was over, Hamlin said to
Gordon, “Do you suppose Coyle meant what he said,
or is there some trick under it?”</p>

<p>“Why, how could there be any trick? He said
positively that thirty-three of them were pledged to
vote for Graham, and none of the rest denied it.”</p>

<p>“I know he did,” said Hamlin doubtfully, “but I
was watching the faces of those fellows while you
were speaking, and I believe there’s something
underhanded going on. I don’t trust Coyle. He’s
tricky.”</p>

<p>“I know he is,” responded Gordon, “and he’d as
soon lie as tell the truth any time; but if he’d been
lying to-day, some of those fellows would have contradicted
him, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it’s all right, but somehow I don’t
feel sure of it,” was Hamlin’s response.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE ELECTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next day, Thursday, when Hamlin reached
the school-room, he found there a group of boys
eagerly discussing the election and the sudden and
unaccountable change in the sentiments of Company
C.</p>

<p>“I can’t see through it,” Raleigh was saying as
Hamlin entered. “Yesterday morning one of the
boys told me that thirty-three of the company were
pledged to vote for Griffin, and in the meeting after
drill you know that Coyle declared that thirty-three
were pledged to vote for Graham. There’s something
snaky about it all, I believe.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” declared Hamlin. “Coyle’s up to
mischief. You know he hates all of us who have
tried to put down disorder in the class, and I don’t
believe he means to vote for Graham any more than
he means to vote for his royal highness, St. John.”</p>

<p>“So I say,” cried Reed. “Coyle’s awful slippery,
and he’ll stop at nothing when he’s made up his
mind to put a scheme through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>Freeman, though not in the battalion, was as
deeply interested as those who were, in the matter
under discussion. As he listened to the talk, he
was idly turning the leaves of a copy of the school
catalogue which was lying on his desk.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang up and held the book open
before Hamlin’s eyes, while he pointed excitedly to
a name in the list of senior pupils. Hamlin looked
at it in a perplexed way for an instant, then he
cried out, “I say, fellows,” but stopping suddenly, he
looked keenly around the room, and then ran and
shut the door into the hall.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with Hamlin? Evidently
he’s <em>not</em> all right,” cried one wonderingly, as
Hamlin began:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There’s not one of Coyle’s crowd here, so I’ll tell
you what’s the matter with Hamlin. I believe
we’ve got hold of Coyle’s scheme, thanks to Freeman.
Look here!”</p>

<p>He held up the catalogue and pointed to one of
the names. It was Thomas Graham Griffin.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” he went on. “Coyle and his
crowd are going to vote for Graham, as he said, but
it’s Graham Griffin, not Alec Graham. He counted
on our not remembering that Griffin’s middle name
is Graham.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, sure as sneezing!” exclaimed Reed,
“and Coyle said it to keep us from trying to get<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
votes for Graham. Well, I call that a right down
mean trick.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Gordon,” cried Freeman, as the door
opened, and at once Gordon was surrounded by the
excited group, all trying to tell him the story at
once. He listened with a troubled face.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too bad,” he said, when the clamor subsided
a little. “If this is so, Graham won’t be
elected at all, and Griffin is no kind of a fellow to
be captain of Company C.”</p>

<p>But now the boys came trooping in, as it was approaching
nine o’clock, and with a hasty word of
caution to let no hint get to Coyle of their understanding
of the real state of things, Gordon took his
seat.</p>

<p>It was not easy for him and some others, however,
to give their usual attention to their studies,
and they were glad when recess set them free to
think and speak of all that was in their thoughts.</p>

<p>Gordon asked permission for a few of the boys to
remain in the school-room during the intermission,
and then the situation was earnestly discussed. The
list of members of Company C was carefully
scanned. Some, they knew, would vote for Griffin;
some, they were sure, would not. But there were
twenty doubtful ones.</p>

<p>“We must manage to see every one of these
twenty,” Gordon said. “Some of them, probably,<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
are pledged to Griffin, but some, I’m sure, would
rather have Graham over them.”</p>

<p>“Unless Coyle has managed somehow to set them
against Graham,” interposed Hamlin.</p>

<p>“How <em>could</em> he set them against Graham?” said
Gordon.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how, but he’s capable of lying to
any extent to do it. We all know that,” answered
Hamlin.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” cried several voices.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we go to some of the nice fellows in
the company and ask them point-blank about it?”
suggested Clark.</p>

<p>“Yes, why not? Seems to me that’s the thing
to do,” said Reed.</p>

<p>“Who’s the best one to do it, then?” questioned
Gordon. “If Coyle has told ’em a lot of stuff to set
’em against Graham, likely he’s said as much about
Hamlin and me, and all the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but all the same, some in Company C are
real good fellows, and if they found that Coyle had
been lying to them about Graham, they wouldn’t
stand by him or his candidate,” said Hamlin.</p>

<p>“I should think four or five of us could do the
business. Each one of the four, say, might see five
of the twenty fellows between now and school
time to-morrow and try to get to the bottom of this,
and at the same time try to get as many as possible
of the twenty to vote for Graham,” said Sherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>“It’s the best thing we can do,” said Gordon,
“though, if they’ve promised Griffin their votes&mdash;” he
added doubtfully.</p>

<p>“If they’ve promised because of false statements
made to them, they have surely a right to change
their votes,” said Clark.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Raleigh; “but see here, can’t we
keep this thing quiet, so that if we do succeed in
making enough fellows change their votes to elect
Graham, that Coyle and his crowd shall not suspect
it?”</p>

<p>“It <em>would</em> be fine if we could keep them in the
dark and turn the tables on them to-morrow at the
election,” laughed Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it, though!” chuckled Reed. “Let’s
try for it, do!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be only too thankful if we can put Graham
in, anyhow,” said Gordon in a troubled voice.
“Griffin’s influence is bad&mdash;a good deal worse than
Professor Keene suspects, or he’d never in the
world allow him to be a candidate.”</p>

<p>“If that is so, Professor Keene ought to know it,”
said Clark.</p>

<p>“Nobody in this crowd goes in for telling tales,”
cried Lee, with a look at Clark that pointed the
remark.</p>

<p>Clark colored and turned away, but instantly
Hamlin’s arm was thrown across his shoulders, and
Hamlin’s clear voice rang out indignantly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“For shame, Lee,” he cried. “We all know that
Clark does not deserve that. I’d like to know if
you consider it more honorable to keep still and let
a bad fellow lead a dozen others into evil ways, than
to warn the professor and so save them. For my
part, I’d rather be called a telltale than to feel that
I’d had a hand in any boy’s downfall.”</p>

<p>Lee’s face darkened, and he muttered something,
under his breath, about “cowards and cheats.”</p>

<p>It was Gordon who broke the silence that followed.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can bear witness that Clark was anything but
cowardly in that affair last year,” he said; “and since
I’ve become better acquainted with him, I’ve been
convinced that there was some underhanded work
about that pony business. I mean that somebody
else, and not Clark, was the one to blame.”</p>

<p>“And I know who it was,” added Reed.</p>

<p>At this, all eyes were turned on him, and half a
dozen voices cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who, who?”</p>

<p>For a moment Reed hesitated, then he said, “Henderson
had a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“Well, who else? Why don’t you out with it?”
questioned Hamlin, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Bet a cooky ’twas Crawford,” cried Raleigh. “It
was, it was!” he added, as Reed colored, and remained
silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Gordon. “It’s too bad to
have anything more come out against Crawford, now
when he’s trying to live down last year’s record.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Reed, earnestly, “and I’m sorry
I spoke, but I’ve felt for a long time that it wasn’t
fair to Clark to keep still about that. Say boys, if
I tell you the whole story, will you all promise not
to repeat a word of it to anyone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried every boy except Clark and Gordon.
The latter, less excitable and more thoughtful
than most of the others, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hold on&mdash;I don’t promise till I’ve thought it all
out. If we’ve been wronging Clark, we owe it to him
to let the truth be known.”</p>

<p>But now Clark spoke. “Boys,” he said, “you have
been wronging me, for I never saw that pony until
Mr. Horton held it up before me; but if all of you
here believe me, I’m perfectly willing to let the
matter rest. Crawford is having a hard enough time
as it is, this year. If he had a hand in this thing,
I’m only too glad to forget it all, if the rest of you
will do the same.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Clark!” cried Reed, but Clark
interposed quickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t! We’ll have a crowd in here to
know what it’s all about.”</p>

<p>Gordon walked over to Clark and held out his
hand as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>“I, for one, have perfect confidence in Clark’s
honor, and I <em>know</em> he’s no coward.”</p>

<p>Clark’s eyes were not so clear as usual as he
wrung the offered hand, but he knew that from
that hour no shadow would rest on his name in the
minds of those present. No shadow? Ah yes&mdash;even
in that the happiest hour of his school life,
the shadow of his father’s sin fell upon him&mdash;and
the light faded from his eyes and his lips took their
old sad curve, as he turned to Reed, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Reed, you <em>know</em> that someone put that pony in
my desk without my knowledge?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Reed, promptly; “I heard the whole
thing planned.”</p>

<p>“Well then, for my sake, I beg that you will
never tell anyone anything more about it. And
boys, once more for my sake, don’t let what Reed
has said make any difference in your treatment of
anyone in the school. Will you all promise?”</p>

<p>Very reluctantly was the promise given, but it
was given.</p>

<p>After school it was decided that Gordon, Hamlin
and Reed should see that day as many as possible
of the twenty boys referred to, in Company C. Then
the three were to meet at Hamlin’s house to compare
notes and see if there was any chance of Graham’s
election. If not, they must decide whether or not
they should refer the matter to Prof. Keene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>At ten o’clock that night, Hamlin was walking
impatiently back and forth in the library, listening
for quick footsteps or a whistle outside. He heard
the steps at last, and had the door open before the
whistle had fairly sounded, and in another moment
he had pushed Gordon and Reed into a couple of
easy-chairs, and was saying, eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, what luck did you have? I’m dying to
know, as the girls say.”</p>

<p>“Prime luck,” cried Reed, while Gordon added,
“We’ll put Graham in, unless I’m much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“But what did you find out?” questioned Hamlin,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“I saw six of the best fellows in Company C.
Two of them were going to vote for Graham, anyhow.
The other four were determined <em>not</em> to vote
for him,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Because Coyle had told them that Graham wanted
to get the captaincy in order to work up a new scheme
that they called self-government?” broke in Hamlin,
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was it,” assented Gordon. “If they did
but know it, that self-government scheme is just
about the best thing that I’ve heard of for boys; but
they’ve gotten the idea that it means all work and
no play&mdash;no freedom or good times of any sort&mdash;and
when Coyle stuffed ’em up with the idea that
we, you and Graham, and I, had got a goody-goody<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
sort of plan all fixed and ready to spring on them as
soon as Graham was elected, they all kicked, of
course, and agreed to vote for Griffin&mdash;those that
didn’t favor Raleigh.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I found out, too,” said Hamlin,
“and that cad of a Coyle had actually told them
that he heard Graham and me talking the thing
over, and, true as you live, I hadn’t heard a word of
it until to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, Gordon talked some of them over,” put in
Reed.</p>

<p>“And Reed talked more of them over,” added Gordon.
“He got all the four he interviewed to promise
to vote for Graham, while I only secured three votes.”</p>

<p>“And I, two. That’s nine out of their thirty-three,”
said Hamlin, exultantly. “So we’ll put Graham
in, won’t we!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure. There’s many a slip, you
know,” quoted Gordon; “but I hope the election
will go all right now.”</p>

<p>“And won’t Coyle and Barber be mad,” laughed
Reed. “I want to sit where I can see ’em when
the vote is announced.”</p>

<p>“If the fellows only keep their word, and don’t let
on that they’ve changed their minds, it will be a big
surprise for Coyle. He’ll be caught in his own trap,
for the boys will vote for Graham as he said, only it
will be the other Graham,” said Gordon, rising.<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
“I’ve got to study till midnight to make up for the
time I’ve spent electioneering,” he added, “but I
won’t grudge it if we put in our candidate. I
shouldn’t wonder if, before we get through with this
business, Coyle should find himself doubly caught
in his own trap.”</p>

<p>He would not stop to explain his words, but
hurried off with Reed, leaving Hamlin, also, to “burn
the midnight oil,” lest he be found wanting in the
class next day.</p>

<p>Lessons suffered the next day, always excepting
St. John’s. He, serenely unmoved by the excitement
about him, rendered his Virgil as smoothly and
poetically as ever, while Hamlin and Gordon listened
ruefully, and even Clark felt less ready than usual
to take his turn. But Mr. Horton, whose keen eyes
and quick ears kept him better informed than the
boys realized, was very lenient that day. He could
not help enjoying such recitations as St. John’s, but
he realized that character and influence were of far
more importance than mere scholarship, and he
knew which boys he had to thank for the change in
section D.</p>

<p>When school was dismissed that afternoon, there
was a rush for the hall. Only those belonging to
the battalion were allowed to enter there, but so
great was the interest in the election, that very few
of the boys who were not in the battalion went<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
home. They hung about the corridors and class-rooms,
waiting to know the result.</p>

<p>In the hall, an intense interest was manifested as
the boys assembled there. Coyle and Barber looked
exultant, but Griffin was nervous and uneasy, and
many of Graham’s friends were nervous and uneasy
too. Even Gordon, Hamlin and Reed, who had
most reason to be confident, were not yet assured of
success. They knew not what unexpected turn
affairs might take at the last moment.</p>

<p>Slips of paper and pencils were distributed, and
as soon as all were ready, the slips were collected,
and Gordon appointed Hamlin and two other
captains as tellers. The slips were divided into
three piles, and each pile was counted by one captain,
and then passed over to a second to be recounted.</p>

<p>Nobody talked while the tellers worked, and
when one of them stepped forward and handed
Gordon a slip of paper, many eyes watched Gordon’s
face, seeking to read there the result. But Gordon’s
face told no tales. There was an intense silence as
he rose with the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“It gives me pleasure to announce that, by a
majority of ten votes, you have elected Captain Alec
Graham,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>Coyle sprang to his feet, with flushed face and
angry eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s no such thing!” he shouted; “I charge
fraud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>“<em>You</em> are hardly the one to make such a charge,”
said Gordon, quietly; then he added, “Will all those
who voted for Captain Graham, please stand and be
counted?”</p>

<p>At once forty-one boys rose.</p>

<p>“Will Lieutenant Gray please call the names of
those standing, and all who choose can count as the
names are called,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>Not even Coyle could deny that forty-one boys
acknowledged that they had voted for Graham. He
dropped into his seat looking furiously angry; nor
was this feeling lessened when Gordon quietly remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is singular that you should be so surprised at
this result when, a few days ago, you yourself announced,
right here in this room, that thirty-three of
Company C were pledged to vote for Graham.”</p>

<p>Coyle cast a vindictive glance at nine of those
thirty-three who had stood to be counted a moment
before, but his reply was muttered too indistinctly
for any but Barber to hear.</p>

<p>The moment the doors were thrown open, the
room was filled with a crowd of eager boys, and the
cheers that greeted the new captain were as gall and
wormwood to Coyle. He had burst into a flood of
angry blame against the nine whose change of vote
had carried the election so differently from what he
had planned and expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></p>

<p>“But, Coyle,” one of these said, as soon as he
could make himself heard, “we promised to vote for
Graham, and we did.”</p>

<p>“Much you did!” shouted Coyle; “I call it right
down sneaky to go back on your word like that.”</p>

<p>“And what do you call it to lie about a fellow as
you did about Graham?” asked another. “Hamlin
says there wasn’t a word of truth in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamlin!” retorted Coyle scornfully. “You
fellows’ll get enough of Hamlin, and of your precious
new captain. <em>Won’t</em> he make you toe the
mark, though&mdash;and <em>I hope he will</em>!” he added,
viciously grinding his teeth as he thought how the
tables had been turned on him.</p>

<p>But how completely his boomerang had rebounded,
he did not know until two months later.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, Graham won favor with
the majority of his company, but the minority that
had wanted Griffin for captain did all in their power
to make it hard and unpleasant for Graham. In
this they were ably seconded, or, more truly, led,
by Griffin, who was lieutenant of the company.
He tried in every way to set the men against
Graham, and instigated them to all sorts of trying,
vexatious blunders and disobediences, hoping thus
to force Graham to resign. But they did not know
their man. All this fretted and rasped Graham, but
never for a moment inclined him to resign. Instead,<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
the more the boys rebelled against his authority, the
more determined he became to compel their obedience.</p>

<p>From Company C, the spirit of insubordination
began to spread until it could no longer be ignored,
and at last Professor Keene called a special meeting
of the officers to consider what should be done.</p>

<p>During the summer vacation, Gordon had visited
a cousin of his who attended a military school where
the self-government plan had been for some time in
force, with great success. Gordon had been several
times on the point of speaking to Professor Keene
about this method, but the remembrance of Coyle’s
story, and the effect it had had upon Company C,
had restrained him.</p>

<p>But at this meeting the professor himself introduced
the subject, saying that he had been talking
with the principal of one of the large military
schools where this plan was employed, and had
been so much interested in what this gentleman had
told him, that he was strongly inclined to try the
method in the battalion.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” he said, “and that is, that
unless there is a great improvement in the order
and discipline of the companies, something must be
done speedily, even if that something is the disbanding
of the battalion. To disband it would be a disgrace
to the school, and especially to those in the<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
battalion, many of whom, I know, have done all in
their power for order and discipline. It is a shame
for a few, comparatively, to work so much harm to
all; but you can see for yourselves that the present
state of things cannot continue.”</p>

<p>“Professor,” said the captain of Company A, “I’ve
heard something about that self-government plan,
and I’d like to know more. Can’t you tell us all
about it?”</p>

<p>“I could,” answered the professor, “but I prefer
to let you know about it from someone better informed.
Suppose I send a committee, composed of
officers of the battalion, to the school I have mentioned.
There you can see and hear for yourselves.”</p>

<p>Here Gordon stepped forward and said a few
words in a tone too low to reach any but the professor’s
ears. The professor nodded, and Gordon returned
to his seat.</p>

<p>Then the professor dismissed the boys, saying
that he would appoint the committee the next day.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be on that committee,” said Graham.
“I never heard of that self-government plan until
the day before I was elected. The talk about it
then set me to inquiring about it, and I’ve heard a
good deal of it lately.”</p>

<p>He spoke clearly and distinctly, so that Coyle,
Griffin, and several of the men of Company C, who
stood near, could not help hearing him. One of the<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
latter looked at Coyle significantly, and whispered,
“Regular boomerang&mdash;that scheme of yours,
Coyle.”</p>

<p>Coyle scowled, and muttered angrily, “You hush
up, Black, if you know when you’re well off!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NEW METHODS IN THE BATTALION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Professor Keene had no need to ask for attention
when, the next day, he was ready to announce
the names of the committee. There was great surprise
and some disappointment among the officers
when it was found that only two of them were of
the number, the other two being privates of Company
C. These last were Knox, one of the most
troublesome fellows in the battalion, and Carr, one
of the most faithful and reliable.</p>

<p>Knox, after the first shock of surprise, was immensely
elated at having been selected. He would
not have been quite so jubilant over it if he had
been present at a conference between the professor,
Gordon and Graham the night before.</p>

<p>Gordon’s whispered words to the professor had
been a request for a talk with him before the
names of the committee should be announced, a request
which was readily granted. The hour that
the two lads spent at the professor’s house that
evening had given him a clearer understanding<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
than he had had before of the state of affairs in
Company C, and indeed in the whole battalion. He
saw that these two boys had given very serious
thought to the situation, and he appreciated the
wisdom of Gordon’s suggestion that Knox, who,
though one of the most troublesome in the company,
was really one of the most soldierly boys, and
one who, if his enthusiasm could once be aroused,
might do perhaps more than any other to raise the
standard of feeling and purpose in the battalion,
should be one of the visiting committee. Carr was
appointed partly to make it pleasanter for Knox
than it would have been had the other three been
officers.</p>

<p>Graham had wanted very much to be on the committee,
as, owing to the trouble he had had with
his company, he was extremely anxious to see for
himself if the new method was one likely to work
well in the high-school battalion; but he saw that it
might not be best for three out of a committee of
four to be taken from Company C. So Hamlin and
one other captain were appointed.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of grumbling over the proposed
innovation, and many of the boys declared
that they would not stay on if any such scheme was
carried out; but all the same, the four members of
the committee were regarded with not a little envy
and scarcely a boy but wished that he had been<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
lucky enough to be selected, especially as the fortunate
four were to be excused from recitations and
given perfect marks for the time of their absence.
Coyle and Griffin, even, would have liked to visit
that school, even though they scoffed at the idea of
the plan proposed.</p>

<p>Before the departure of the committee, Professor
Keene wrote a long letter to his friend, the principal,
explaining to him the reason for the sending of
this committee, and for the selection of Knox as a
member of it, and asking him to give the boys every
possible opportunity to learn all about the working
of the system under consideration. Also he begged
the principal to make the visit of the boys as enjoyable
as might be, and proposed that, a week or two
later, a similar committee from the military school
be sent down to return the visit. “And be sure and
put on that committee some of your most enthusiastic
boys, who will talk the thing up, and make our
boys wild to try it,” the professor had added.</p>

<p>A royal good time indeed those four boys had
during the two days they spent at the Institute.</p>

<p>The principal was one who knew how to get hold
of boys and win their affection as well as secure
their obedience. Understanding thoroughly the situation
of affairs at the high school, he told his boys
just enough to interest them, and incline them to
further Professor Keene’s plans. The boys needed<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
only a hint. In the first place, they were exceedingly
proud of their school and their military discipline,
and, in the second, they were always ready
to respond to any appeal from their principal.</p>

<p>So they gave our committee of four a cordial,
boyish reception that swept away in a moment
every shadow of stiffness or shyness. They treated
them like comrades and old friends, and took them
into class-room and drill, gave them a dinner, and,
in short, filled every hour of the two days with
something that would please and interest their
guests. Of course, they interlarded all this with
information about their method of government and
its eminently satisfactory results, until even Knox,
who had intended to have a good time on the trip
and laugh the new plan to scorn when he returned
to the Central, became so interested that he found
himself asking eager questions, and admitting to
himself that perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad thing to
try at the Central, after all.</p>

<p>When, on the last day of the visit, the principal
told the assembled school of Professor Keene’s invitation,
and asked those who would like to accept it,
and visit the Central school, to rise, instantly every
boy in the room was on his feet.</p>

<p>The principal smiled as he turned to Gordon, and
said, “You have taken the citadel by storm, you see.
I think you will have to select your committee for
yourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” was Gordon’s quick response,
“we shall be satisfied if the committee includes all
the gentlemen that are now standing.”</p>

<p>A cheer broke from the students at this reply, but
at a sign from the principal every boy took his seat,
and in an instant the most perfect order prevailed.</p>

<p>But nearly the whole school accompanied the
high-school boys to the station that night, and the
cheers that followed them as the train moved off
could have been heard for a mile around.</p>

<p>The visitors supposed that was the end of it, but
when they reached the next station, there were
a hundred or more students drawn up in line on
the platform. In perfect order they stood till the
train started on, when again the night resounded
with the Central high-school cry, followed by that
of the Institute. That <em>was</em> the end, for there was
no such short cut to the next station as there
had been to this.</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that our committee returned
overflowing with enthusiasm for the methods that
turned out such boys as these? Even Knox gave
up all thought of carping criticism and opposition,
and instead, gave his comrades such a glowing
description of the drill he had witnessed and the
splendid results of the self-government plan, as
shown at the Institute, that they looked at him
in amazement and thought there “must be something<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
in it to convert Knox so completely,” and
they began to look forward with eager curiosity and
interest to the coming of “those Institute chaps.”</p>

<p>So full of interest and enthusiasm was the committee
of four, that Professor Keene decided to have
them give their report before the entire school. At
first the boys objected strongly to this. They did
not so much mind speaking before all the boys, but
the girls too&mdash;that was another thing!</p>

<p>But after all, it was not so bad, for their interest
soon made them forget the gentler portion of their
audience, and when they had each spoken of the
points that had most impressed them, and told of
the cordial hospitality they had enjoyed&mdash;they could
not help speaking of that&mdash;the professor said that
the committee would answer any questions that
might occur to any one.</p>

<p>A storm of eager questions followed, and not all
of them were asked by the boys.</p>

<p>Many of the pupils saw at once the advantages
of the method proposed, and many were eager to
have it adopted, at least in the battalion, but some
still fought against it, and none more bitterly than
Coyle and Griffin.</p>

<p>A week or two later, a delegation came from the
Institute, and the four members of the committee
had an opportunity to return the hospitality that
had been shown them; an opportunity which they<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
were not slow to improve. Either there was an
exceptionally fine class of boys at the Institute, or
else the principal had shown great wisdom in
his selection, for they made friends of everybody,
from Professor Keene down to the roughest and
rudest boys in Company C. Even Coyle and Griffin
were forced to acknowledge that they were “good
fellows enough.”</p>

<p>But amid all the good times crowded into these
two days, the boys did not forget the purpose of
their coming. They were always ready to talk self-government
to anyone who was interested, but
they did it so wisely that nobody was bored or
offended, while most were so convinced of the
advantages of the system that, to the great satisfaction
of the Institute boys, the battalion voted by a
large majority to try the plan for the remainder
of the year.</p>

<p>Of course, the entire battalion escorted their
guests to the depot when the visit was ended, and
though they could not be in waiting at a station
further on, they did the best they could. They engaged
a brass-band to meet the committee at the
station nearest the Institute, and give the boys a
welcome home with all the martial music that they
could render.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the most friendly relations
continued between the two schools from this<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
time on, each manifesting a strong interest in the
doings of the other.</p>

<p>At the Central, after a spirited meeting, an election
was held, resulting in the appointment of
Gordon as judge, with a jury of twelve boys, two
from each company.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, the first offender brought
before this court was Coyle himself, and his disgust
at this was in no wise lessened by the knowledge
that he himself had actually been the one largely
instrumental in bringing this new court of justice
into being, in the Central.</p>

<p>Coyle had deteriorated steadily as the weeks
passed. He was a thorn in the flesh to Gordon,
Hamlin and Clark, for his frequent failures in class
brought down the record, in spite of the good work
of the majority. Coyle rejoiced that this was so.
In no other way could he have so effectually
annoyed and tormented these three, whom he hated
more and more as he saw how their influence was
growing in the school. They had even succeeded in
arousing a feeble ambition in Barber, and consequently,
Barber was “no fun at all,” these days.
He insisted on pegging away at his lessons, and
wouldn’t, half the time, help Coyle “make things a
bit lively in class.” In short, Coyle considered
himself decidedly aggrieved because the boys of
section D were working for honors, or for solid<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
acquirements, this year, instead of wasting their
time in foolish tricks, or idling the hours away
without accomplishing anything. True, there were
still in Company C a few jolly chaps who went in
for good times, but most of the fellows had taken
up with that fol-de-rol about self-government, and
wouldn’t so much as wink or “crack a smile” in
drill, nor answer back, no matter what ridiculous
order an officer might give them. All this was contrary
to Coyle’s ideas, and he came to the conclusion
at last that he would let them all see that he, for
one, had a little spirit and independence, and didn’t
choose to be ordered about by any of them. Wasn’t
he battalion quartermaster, ranking as high as any
of the captains? Long he pondered and planned,
but he could not hit upon any way of asserting his
independence and humiliating his brother officers at
the same time.</p>

<p>He not only neglected his studies and fell steadily
behind the class, but he attended so poorly to his
duties as quartermaster that Gordon was finally
obliged to speak to him on the subject, and though
he took pains to speak privately, and in the most
courteous way possible, Coyle was very angry, and
answered so insolently that Gordon had hard work
to control his temper.</p>

<p>A few days after this, the quartermaster’s accounts
were sent to Gordon for approval, and finding<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
several errors in them, he sent them back for
correction. Without stopping to look over the accounts,
Coyle went directly to Gordon and angrily
accused him of picking flaws in the accounts on
purpose to bring him&mdash;Coyle&mdash;into disgrace.</p>

<p>“The accounts are right to a penny, and you know
it,” he shouted furiously. “You’ve been trying to find
something against me all this year, and now you’ve
hatched this up. If there is any error in the books
you’ve changed the figures yourself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Gordon turned fairly white in the strong effort he
made to control himself, while Hamlin started to his
feet with an indignant exclamation, and another officer
who was standing by clenched his fists and
took a step forward, looking as if he longed to knock
the impudent fellow down.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, then Gordon
turned to his adjutant, and said very quietly, “You
will consider Mr. Coyle under arrest.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you try to arrest me,” blustered
Coyle, who had lost all control of himself by this
time. As he spoke, Prof. Keene entered the room.</p>

<p>“What is that, Coyle?” he said, sharply, “please
repeat what you said.”</p>

<p>Coyle shrank a little before the professor’s stern
eyes, but he repeated still angrily, “I said that I’d
like to see Gordon arrest me. He’s finding fault
with me about&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“Silence, sir,” interrupted the professor; “if <em>Major</em>
Gordon has ordered you under arrest, he must have
had good reasons for so doing, and your case will be
tried by court-martial.” And without another word,
the professor left the room.</p>

<p>So it came about that Coyle was the first offender
tried and sentenced under the new rules. Prof. Keene
was not present during the trial, but a full account of
the proceedings, in shorthand, was submitted to him,
and he fully approved the sentence, which was that
Coyle be degraded to the ranks or permitted to resign,
whichever he chose. He chose the latter, and
did not appear again in the school, which was altogether
the most satisfactory ending to the matter,
since, with such a boy, there was no hope of any
real reform.</p>

<p>This affair of Coyle’s had a good effect upon the
worst element in the battalion. The boys saw that
the majority were determined to put down disorder
and insubordination, and that Prof. Keene was ready
to second their efforts at reform. They did not want
to be suspended from the battalion or the school, or
told that their permanent absence was desired&mdash;and
so they concluded that it would be wisest for them
to obey orders and do their best, instead of worst, in
drill and class-room, and the result was soon seen in
better recitations, and much more orderly class-rooms,
and a steady improvement in the drill.</p>

</div>


<p>“You fellows in the battalion have all the good
times. I just wish I’d entered the high school first
year, then I’d have been an officer by this time,” said
Dixon to Reed, one day, with an admiring glance at
the other’s neat uniform and shoulder straps.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Reed, “it’s <em>such</em> fun to drill three
times a week, especially when the thermometer
climbs up among the eighties&mdash;say about next
May. We generally have a hot wave along that
time.”</p>

<p>“It’s no fun to carry those heavy muskets,” put
in Freeman. “I joined the cadets first year, but the
guns were too heavy for me, and I had to quit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re a little chap,” and Dixon glanced
half-contemptuously at the slender lad. Freeman’s
cheeks flushed at the look.</p>

<p>“Well, I never fainted, anyhow,” he said; “and
some fellows a good deal bigger than I fainted more
than once that year.”</p>

<p>“That was when we had heavy guns. We use
lighter ones, now,” said Reed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to wear that uniform,” went on Dixon;
“I notice how the girls watch you fellows; girls
like a uniform, you know.”</p>

<p>A shout of laughter greeted this remark, and one
boy said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Too bad you can’t wear a uniform, Rosy. You
might try to get on the police force next year. Maybe
the girls would watch <em>you</em>, then.”</p>

<p>Rosy joined in the laugh that greeted this suggestion.
He was never backward about acknowledging
to an interest in the girls, and was forever begging
some boy to introduce him to one or another girl of
his acquaintance. Sometimes his interest in the
feminine portion of the school got him into trouble,
as was the case a little later on this same day.</p>

<p>When school was dismissed, the boys formed in
line, and were expected to go through the corridors,
and down the stairs in this order.</p>

<p>But there are always disorderly boys, and noisy
ones too, and very often Professor Keene would be
on the stairs, or in one or other of the corridors, to
take note of any such; and not seldom would he
send a boy back to his class-room, there to wait until
all the others had passed out.</p>

<p>On this occasion, as the boys were standing in
line in the upper hall, waiting for the signal to
move on, “Rosy” noticed that the door of one of the
girls’ rooms, near which he stood, was ajar. He<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
glanced quickly to right and left. The professor
was nowhere in sight, so he leaned over and softly
pushed the door open a little farther so that he
could look in. As he did so, a hand dropped heavily
on his shoulder, and the professor’s voice sounded
in his ears.</p>

<p>“Dixon,” he said, “I see you are anxious to make
the acquaintance of Miss Bent and her class. Step
right in, and I will introduce you”; and with his
hand still on the boy’s shoulder, he threw open the
door, and led him to the platform.</p>

<p>“Miss Bent,” he said, “this young gentleman was
so very eager to meet you and the young ladies of
your class, that I took the liberty of bringing him
in. Allow me to introduce Mr. Dixon.”</p>

<p>For once, Dixon was too confused to be equal to
the occasion. His face was as red as his hair, and
the bow with which he acknowledged the introduction
was not a model of ease and grace. No wonder&mdash;when
forty girls sat there enjoying his discomfiture,
and laughing at the haste with which he
departed.</p>

<p>Shouts of “Here comes Rosy!” “Did you have
introductions enough, Rosy?” “Say, which was the
prettiest girl?” “Why didn’t you stay longer?”
greeted him, as he reached the playground, where
most of his own classmates were waiting for him;
but, by this time, he had recovered his self-possession,<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
and only laughed good-naturedly at the sallies
of the boys.</p>

<p>When he entered the school-room next morning,
two or three voices called out, “Wrong room, Rosy.
The girls’ room is on the other side.”</p>

<p>Dixon grinned, as he perched on the top of his
desk, and looked about, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Some of you chaps must have gotten up before
breakfast this morning. Never saw so many here
at half past eight, before.”</p>

<p>“Written exam. to-day, sonny,” said Barber.</p>

<p>“Looks as if ’twas house-cleaning, to-day,” replied
Dixon, glancing at the pile of books and papers
Barber was hauling out of his desk.</p>

<p>“Does look rather that way,” said Barber. Then
he glanced about the room, and added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Say, if any of you fellows have jagged my notebook,
give it back, will you. It’s a new one, and I
know I left it here last night.”</p>

<p>“You’re dreaming, Barber,” somebody remarked.
“Nobody’s been near your desk.”</p>

<p>“But somebody has, though,” persisted Barber;
“an’ ’tisn’t the first time, either. My knife vanished
last week&mdash;the third one I’ve lost this quarter.”</p>

<p>“Better have your mother sew up the holes in
your pockets,” suggested Raleigh.</p>

<p>“Or you might fasten a string to your knife and
tie it into your pocket,” added another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“I tell you, the things are taken out of my desk,”
insisted Barber, “and somebody does it after school.
I like fun as well as anybody, but I’m sick of this
kind, and I think it’s time now for whoever did it
to hand over my notebook.”</p>

<p>“Is it so, for a fact, Barber?” said Hamlin, walking
over to the other’s seat. “Have you been losing
things out of your desk&mdash;honest Injun?”</p>

<p>“I have so,” replied Barber.</p>

<p>“And I, too. I left a gold pen in my desk last
week, and the next morning it was gone,” said Lee.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry, it proved that nearly all the boys
present had lost something from their desks within
a few weeks, and several had lost small change or
car-tickets from the pockets of overcoats left in the
dressing-room during school hours.</p>

<p>“We must tell Mr. Horton,” said Hamlin. “It
won’t do to have this sort of thing going on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” broke out Dixon, “you don’t really
believe that anybody’s been thieving here, do you?
I’m always thinking I’ve lost something, and finding
it a week or two later, where I’d poked it away, an’
forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>Barber shook his head.</p>

<p>“I poked my new notebook into my desk yesterday
just before I went home,” he said, positively.
“I can’t be mistaken about that.”</p>

<p>“Crawford, you look melancholy. Have you lost
something, too?” called out Dixon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford, shortly.</p>

<p>“Not even your temper,” suggested Dixon, who
seemed to be in a tormenting mood that morning.</p>

<p>Crawford was standing with his hands in his
pockets, and looking moodily out of the window.
He made no reply to Dixon’s last remark.</p>

<p>“Clark seems to be the only one who has lost
nothing,” remarked Lee, with a significant emphasis
that implied more than the words themselves.</p>

<p>Clark looked up inquiringly, while Hamlin exclaimed
quickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Lee?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Lee, carelessly, “only some
things that happened last term have never been
really cleared up.”</p>

<p>Before the words were fairly out of Lee’s mouth,
Crawford had wheeled around and caught him by
the shoulder. Lee never flinched, and, for an instant
the two boys stood gazing angrily into each
other’s eyes.</p>

<p>Hamlin, too, had started towards Lee, but stopped
as he caught sight of Crawford’s white, set face.</p>

<p>“Well, what are <em>you</em> going to do about it?” demanded
Lee coolly of Crawford.</p>

<p>“I am going to knock you down if you accuse
Stanley Clark of doing anything mean or underhanded
since he’s been in this school,” said Crawford,
while Clark looked from one to the other in<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
blank amazement, and the rest of the boys gathered
about the two.</p>

<p>“So?” said Lee, tauntingly. “Perhaps, then, <em>you</em>
know more than the rest of us about some of these
underhanded performances.”</p>

<p>The perspiration gathered on Crawford’s forehead
in big drops, and the hand that still clutched Lee’s
shoulder, trembled perceptibly, but he faced the
wondering group, and said slowly, and distinctly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> know something about at least one underhanded
performance that concerns Clark. I’ve been
longing to make a clean breast of it for weeks, and
now I’m going to do it. <em>I</em> put that pony in Clark’s
desk last year. The letters S. C. were the initials of&mdash;someone
else, and Clark told the truth when he
said that he had never seen the book until Mr. Horton
held it up before him. I hated Clark last year,
and I wanted to do anything I could to injure him.
Clark,” he left Lee and turned towards the other,
“Clark, it isn’t much to say I’m sorry&mdash;but that’s
all I can say.”</p>

<p>Clark instantly held out his hand, and said cordially:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is all forgotten from this moment, Crawford,”
and then, catching sight of Mr. Horton, who had entered
the room while Crawford was speaking, Clark
added quickly, “It can end right here, can’t it, sir?”</p>

<p>But Crawford spoke before the teacher could reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I want all the class to know the
truth. Then perhaps I can respect myself a little
more.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Crawford,” said Mr. Horton, “it shall
be as you wish. I think you are right, and one who
can so frankly and manfully acknowledge his fault,
cannot fail to win back the respect of his classmates.”</p>

<p>Crawford dropped into his seat with a flush of
pleasure at these words, and the boys separated, but
more than one glanced coldly at Lee, and Hamlin
could not refrain from saying, as he passed Lee’s
seat:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hope you are satisfied now, and will stop hounding
Clark for the future.”</p>

<p>Lee made no reply, but he thought to himself,
“Clark didn’t cheat that time, it seems, but he’s the
son of a defaulter; and no <em>Southern</em> boy would take
a blow as he did last year.”</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was much disturbed when he learned
of the petty stealings that had been going on in the
school. Soon, not from section D alone, but from all
over the school came complaints of losses of greater
or less value. The teachers were very much troubled
over the matter. They could not bear to suspect any
pupil in the school, but no one else had access to
class-rooms and dressing-rooms except the janitor,
and he had been in charge of the building for years,<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
and nothing of this kind had ever before occurred.
A strict watch was kept over the dressing-rooms
through the day, and no scholars were allowed to
enter the class-rooms until the teachers came in the
morning, or to remain after the departure of the
teachers in the afternoon. In spite of these rules
however, the losses continued.</p>

<p>One wet day, Raleigh, who lived a long way from
the school, was obliged to walk home because the
car-tickets he had carelessly left in his overcoat pocket,
were missing. The next morning, he appeared
wearing an old shabby overcoat in place of the new
one he had had the day before.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Raleigh? Has your new coat
been jagged?” questioned Barber, overtaking him
near the school gate.</p>

<p>“No,” said Raleigh, “but if you’ll keep mum, I’ll
tell you why I wore this.”</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word,” said Barber, promptly, and
Raleigh went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My car-tickets vanished yesterday. Served me
right, I suppose, for being such a ninny as to leave
them in my overcoat pocket; but it made me mad
to have to foot it all the way home in the wet, so I
planned a little scheme to put a mark on the stealer.
My sister has some shoe blacking that stains like
fury&mdash;worse than any ink I ever got hold of&mdash;and
I’ve soaked a sponge with it, and put it in my side
pocket, here. See?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[206]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Barber, “how’s that going to mark
the thief?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve put half a dollar&mdash;a counterfeit one,
you understand, that somebody shoved off on my
mother&mdash;I’ve put it into that same pocket, and if
anybody puts a hand in to haul out that half-dollar,
he’ll get a mark on his fingers that he can’t scrub off
in one day, now I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Well, that <em>is</em> a scheme,” laughed Barber, “but
you ought to let one fellow in every room into it,
for you and I can’t examine all the paws in the
school, ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; I never thought of that,” said Raleigh.</p>

<p>So the two decided upon one boy in each room
who should be the one to keep an eye on the hands
in his class-room in case that fifty cents should be
missing later in the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton having given Raleigh permission for
himself and Barber to remain in the room that
morning, during recess, as soon as the other boys
had gone down to the playground, the amateur detectives
began operations. They borrowed from the
dressing-room a mirror which they hung on the wall
in such a way that it reflected the hall and the door
of the dressing-room to them, while they, having set
open the door of the class-room, were out of sight
behind it.</p>

<p>Five minutes of the recess had slipped away&mdash;ten,
and not a person had passed through the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” began Barber in a whisper, but
at that instant Raleigh gave him a poke, and pointed
to the mirror. Through the hall a boy was passing
quickly, glancing furtively about him as he went.</p>

<p>While they looked, he slipped noiselessly into the
dressing-room and softly closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Raleigh and Barber looked at each other with astonished
faces.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it,” whispered Barber, and:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I never would have believed it,” said Raleigh, in
the same breath.</p>

<p>Then he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His going in there is no proof, though it’s against
the rules now.”</p>

<p>In silence then the two sat, their eyes fixed on
the telltale mirror.</p>

<p>“There goes the bell,” whispered Barber. “He’s
probably going to wait there and drop in at the end
of the line. We must get out of this corner before
the boys come up.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and wait near the stairs; then we can
see him when he comes out, without his suspecting.”</p>

<p>This they did, and without seeming to look, saw
Dixon suddenly and silently fling open the door of
the dressing-room as the last boy passed by, and
follow quickly to the class-room.</p>

<p>Then Raleigh hurried into the dressing-room,
slipping an old glove on to his right hand as he<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
went. He rejoined Barber in a moment, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s gone.”</p>

<p>“The half-dollar?” questioned Barber.</p>

<p>Raleigh nodded, and the two went into the class-room.
Each cast a quick glance at Dixon as they
passed his seat, and both saw that he was rubbing
his right hand with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>As they took their seats, Barber glanced at
Raleigh with a quick gesture towards St. John. He,
too, was rubbing his handkerchief over his right
hand, and eyeing with a disgusted expression some
black stains that showed conspicuously on his slender
white fingers.</p>

<p>Presently, Raleigh went to the desk, and told Mr.
Horton, in a tone too low for any other ears, the
result of their watch.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>“There <em>must</em> be some mistake,” he said. “I cannot
believe it of either of them.”</p>

<p>Then placing Gordon in charge of the room, he
went to confer with Professor Keene. The result
was that when the class was dismissed, St. John,
Dixon, Raleigh and Barber were told to remain.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Horton took St. John into the dressing-room
alone. The boy followed him with evident
bewilderment, and when the teacher said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“St. John, will you tell me how you got those
stains on your hand?” he looked as if he thought<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
himself the victim of some practical joke, and drawing
himself up, answered haughtily and coldly,
“That is my affair, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, it would be your affair, St. John,”
answered Mr. Horton patiently, “but, unfortunately,
to-day I must insist upon an answer to my question.”</p>

<p>The boy bit his lip and hesitated, evidently half
inclined to refuse to answer, but there was something
in Mr. Horton’s face that puzzled and rather
awed him, and after a moment’s silence he said
sulkily:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The janitor did not fill my inkstand, and I had
to go down to that beastly old cellar and fill it myself,
and I got the ink on my hand. I never went
to a school before where I had to do servant’s
work,” he added with his haughtiest air.</p>

<p>“Did anyone see you filling your inkstand?”
asked the teacher.</p>

<p>“The janitor was muddling around there,” answered
the boy. “I told him it was his business to
do it for me, and he had the impudence to tell me
that it was as much my business as his.”</p>

<p>Mr. Horton half smiled, understanding that St.
John’s overbearing manner would not be likely to
incline the somewhat crusty old janitor to save him
any trouble; but remembering the serious question
at issue, his face grew grave again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>“Have you been in the dressing-room to-day?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Very well; you may go,” and, as St. John went
down the stairs, Mr. Horton returned to the school-room,
where he found the three boys sitting in a
sort of embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>“Dixon,” he said at once, “I see you have stained
your hand. How did you do it?”</p>

<p>Dixon glanced at his fingers, and the color suddenly
flamed in his freckled cheeks.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;hit it against something black,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” said Mr. Horton. “Dixon, were
you in the dressing-room at recess?”</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, glanced half appealingly at the
teacher, and then at the boys.</p>

<p>“Would you rather see me alone?” asked Mr.
Horton, and as the boy nodded, he signed to Raleigh
and Barber to leave the room. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dixon, it will be best for you to tell me the
whole truth frankly; best for your own sake, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not thinking about myself, you know,”
said Dixon. “It’s&mdash;” then he stopped.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Mr. Horton, inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Dixon desperately, “I <em>don’t</em> know
what to do,” and putting his head down on his desk,
he actually sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>The teacher’s hand was laid kindly on the rough,
red hair, as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A fault confessed is half forgiven, Dixon, and
though this is more than a fault, for it is a most
grave and serious matter, yet a frank and full
acknowledgment will incline us to deal as leniently
as possible with you.”</p>

<p>Dixon raised his head. There was a bewildered
expression in his blue eyes which changed to one of
indignant astonishment as the meaning of his
teacher’s words dawned upon him. He started up,
dashing the tears from his freckled cheeks as he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you suspect <em>me</em> of stealing!”</p>

<p>“Well, really,” said Mr. Horton, actually moving
back a step before the indignant flash of those blue
eyes. “Well, really, I begin to think I do not,
though I must confess that I did a few moments
ago. Tell me all about it, Dixon. Evidently you
know something about the matter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I wish I didn’t,” and again the freckled
face was hidden by the stained fingers. After a
moment’s silence, he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Horton, if I can promise you <em>sure</em> that
nothing else will be taken, won’t that do?” he asked
imploringly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that won’t do, Dixon. I see that you<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
are trying to shield the guilty person, but it is not
fair to those who have been robbed, nor do I believe
that it would be best for the one who deserves punishment
to go scot free. It would encourage him to
repeat the crime. Yes,” as Dixon started at the
word, “it <em>is</em> a crime, and one that will put the guilty
person behind the prison bars, if continued.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Horton, you won’t put him in prison,
will you? Promise me you won’t, or I’ll <em>never</em> tell.
I’ll go to prison for it myself first,” he cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, my boy,” and Mr. Horton laid his
hand on the boy’s shoulder. “If you do not tell
what you know, we shall surely find out for ourselves
who is the guilty person, and then it may be
too late for any word of yours to be of any benefit to
him. Be persuaded, Dixon, and tell me all you
know about the matter, now.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I will,” said the boy, after a moment’s
thought; “only, Mr. Horton, I shall depend on you
to save him from prison, if you anyway can. You
see he’s a little fellow, only thirteen, and it will
break his mother’s heart if he’s sent to prison. His
mother is an old friend of my mother’s, and when I
came in to the city to go to school, last year, I went
to her house to board. She’s a widow, and keeps a
boarding-house ’way up town. Well, sir, the very
day after I went there, I was taken sick with typhoid<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
fever, and my mother was sick at home, so
she couldn’t come to me, and Mrs. Gray took care of
me just as if I had been her own boy. She sat up
nights with me, and oh, I can’t tell you how good
she was through all those weeks. The doctor told
mother afterwards that I owed my life to Mrs.
Gray’s care and nursing, so you see, I can’t help
thinking a lot of her, and I’ve tried my best to keep
Willie straight; but lately, he’s got to going with
one or two bad fellows in the school, and I think,
Mr. Horton, that they make a cat’s-paw of him, and
make him do things that he’d never think of doing
himself, for he <em>isn’t</em> a bad boy really&mdash;Willie isn’t&mdash;and
he’s all his mother has left.”</p>

<p>Again the rough red head went down on the desk,
and the boy’s low sobs proved the depth of his sympathy
for the widowed mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton’s own eyes were dim as he looked
down at the lad.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me how you came to be in the
dressing-room at recess,” he said gently, after a little
silence.</p>

<p>“Why, I hunted all over the playground for
Willie, and when I found he wasn’t there, I felt
somehow that I <em>must</em> find him, and be sure he
wasn’t doing anything wrong. You see, I only
found out about this a few days ago, and he had
promised me solemnly that he’d never take another<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
thing that did not belong to him. You know there’s
another dressing-room adjoining ours, and the windows
of the two are only a foot apart. As I came
through the hall, I saw Willie slip into that other
room, and I got to the door just in time to see him
climb up on the window sill. I didn’t dare speak,
for fear he’d fall, but I waited till he’d climbed
from one window to the other, and slipped down
into our dressing-room, and then went in, and shut
the door after me. Willie had his hand in the
pocket of an old overcoat, one I never saw before.
I snatched his hand as he drew it out, and it was
all wet with what looked like ink, and that’s the
way mine got daubed.”</p>

<p>“And Willie kept the half-dollar he found in the
overcoat?” said Mr. Horton.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I made him give it up, and I put it back
in the pocket.”</p>

<p>“And then?” questioned the teacher.</p>

<p>“Then he cried, and said that those fellows had
threatened to tell Professor Keene that he was a
thief, unless he’d keep on taking things. He hasn’t
kept a single thing himself, Mr. Horton. They lent
him some money a while ago, and because he
couldn’t pay it back, they kept at him, telling him
that he could easily pick up loose change enough in
the dressing-rooms to pay the debt, and after he had
taken one piece of money, then you see, they held
that over him to make him keep on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>“And these boys; who are they?” said Mr. Horton
sternly.</p>

<p>Again Dixon hesitated, but in his heart he knew
that such boys were too dangerous to be suffered to
remain in the school to lead weak boys astray, and
so he gave the names.</p>

<p>When at last Raleigh and Barber were called in,
they were glad enough to learn that their classmate
was not the thief; and Dixon, his mind relieved by
having passed the responsibility over to Mr. Horton,
could even laugh at his stained fingers, while he appreciated
Raleigh’s ingenious plan.</p>

<p>“Funny what became of that coin, though,” the
latter said, as he took his old coat from the nail
where it hung.</p>

<p>“I rather think there’s a hole in this pocket,
Raleigh,” said Mr. Horton, feeling at the bottom of
the coat “See here!” and he held up the side
where the coin could be plainly felt between the
outside and the lining.</p>

<p>Dixon told the two boys enough of Willie Gray’s
story to explain his own connection with the affair,
and awaken their sympathy for the widowed
mother.</p>

<p>There were no more losses that year, in the
Central school.</p>

<p>Willie Gray’s interview with Professor Keene,
and his suspension from the school for a month
proved a lesson that he did not care to have repeated,<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
but his severest punishment was in seeing
his mother’s bitter shame and sorrow when she heard
the story. He wore very shabby clothes the rest
of that year, and so did his mother, but by the end
of the school year every scholar’s loss had been
made good, and from that time on no more scrupulously
honest boy than Willie Gray could have been
found in all that city.</p>

<p>As to Dixon, Raleigh and Barber conceived a new
respect and regard for him after this affair, and even
his openly expressed liking and admiration for “the
girls,” awakened amusement instead of scorn.</p>

<p>“For you see, boys,” Dixon said one day confidentially
to the two, “You see, boys, I’ve got a lot of
sisters at home&mdash;half a dozen of ’em&mdash;and a right
pretty lot they are too. You wouldn’t think they
were any relation to a freckled carrot-head like me.
But, bless you&mdash;they have never found out how
homely I am, and, as I’m the only brother they’ve
got, I’ve been kind of spoiled, I reckon. Anyhow,
you wouldn’t believe how I miss those girls, and I
like <em>all</em> girls for their sakes, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>St. John never found out that a suspicion had
rested upon him. Indeed, it is doubtful if he knew
that there had been any losses, since, as it happened,
nothing had been taken from his desk; and
Hamlin never again saw Dixon hanging about a
saloon, since he no longer had to look for Willie
Gray in such places.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A SNOWBALL FIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Just after New-Year came a very heavy snowstorm.
It lasted two days, and when the boys went
to school on the third morning, they had to wade
through drifts in some places as high as their
shoulders. Even on a level the snow was up to the
knees of the smaller boys.</p>

<p>It was a huge frolic to most of them, and the
best part of it was when they found that, owing to
some trouble with the furnace, there would be no
school in the boys’ department that day.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for a holiday!” shouted half a dozen
voices, as the boys tumbled pellmell down the stairs,
not considering it necessary, under the circumstances,
to keep in line as usual.</p>

<p>“Won’t the girls envy us, though,” chuckled
Dixon, lifting his cap with great politeness as he saw
two or three girls looking out of one of their windows.
“I’ve half a mind to go and smash <em>their</em>
furnace, so they can get out too.”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Hamlin, dryly. He had long since
arrived at the conclusion that “Rosy” had “plenty<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
of good points,” but even yet Dixon’s frequent
references to “the girls” were apt to vex him, and
he had never been willing to introduce his red-haired
schoolmate to his cousin Grace or any other of his
girl friends.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, why can’t we build a fort and have
a snowball fight instead of going home,” cried Reed.
“The snow’s in prime condition. Just see what balls
it makes,” he added, catching up a handful of snow
and hastily fashioning it into a ball which he flung
at Hamlin, who dodged just in time to avoid it, and
it landed full in Dixon’s mouth, as he opened it to
speak. He spluttered and gasped for a moment, but
as soon as he could get his breath, he dashed at
Reed and rolled him in the snow, rubbing a handful
of it into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Ouch! ouch!” yelled Reed; “help, help, boys!”
whereupon two or three ran to his rescue, and the
next moment, Dixon was treated to a dose of his
own medicine. He took it very good-naturedly; he
always did take everything good-naturedly. Even
the boys that disliked him could not deny that.</p>

<p>“Say we <em>do</em> have a snowball fight. We may not
have another chance this year,” said Sherman.</p>

<p>“Professor would order us off. The girls couldn’t
recite if we were yelling outside here,” suggested
Graham.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact! I forgot about the girls,” murmured
Rosy, at which somebody remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>“First time in your life you ever forgot ’em, ain’t
it, Rosy?” and there was a general laugh at Dixon’s
expense.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go out on the vacant lots, then. No
hospital or old ladies’ home around there, is there?”
said Barber.</p>

<p>“Never heard of any. Come on, then,” cried
Hamlin, leading the way. Presently he turned, and
inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What’ll we do for shovels and brooms? We
can’t build a fort without ’em.”</p>

<p>“So we can’t,” said Reed, ruefully. “I forgot all
about them.”</p>

<p>“Let’s borrow some,” suggested Graham.</p>

<p>“Where?” said Lee, with the touch of scorn in
his voice that always irritated the boys.</p>

<p>“Right here on this block,” retorted Graham
promptly.</p>

<p>“As if the people in these houses would lend us
their snow shovels,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“If I get the shovels, will you agree to pay your
share of the price?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“Of course; don’t I always pay my share of anything
that’s going,” said Lee, haughtily.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Graham as, with a grin at
Hamlin, he ran up the steps of the nearest house
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Want your walk cleared?” he inquired of the
servant girl who opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>“How much do you charge?” said the girl; “And
where’s your shovel?”</p>

<p>“Where’s yours? Have you one?” replied
Graham.</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;yes,” said the girl, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, tell your mistress that we’ll clear the steps
and walk in fine style, if she’ll lend us her shovel
for an hour afterward.”</p>

<p>“Get along with ye,” said the girl, “we’d never
set eyes on the shovel again!”</p>

<p>At this, the crowd of boys on the sidewalk set up
a shout of laughter, but Graham persisted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ask the lady to come to the door a minute,
please do! We’ll clear the walk; honor bright, we
will.”</p>

<p>As Graham spoke, the mistress appeared in the
hall, and inquired of the girl what the boys wanted.
Graham’s face lighted up as he caught sight of her,
and he stepped forward, with his cap in his hand,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that you lived here, Mrs. Hayes,
but we boys want some shovels and brooms to make
a snow fort on the vacant lots over yonder. We’ll
clear off all the steps on this block, and the sidewalk
too, if we can have the use of half a dozen shovels
for an hour, to build our fort.”</p>

<p>“You can have ours, and welcome,” said Mrs.
Hayes, “and I’ll give you a note to the other people<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
on the block. Of course you won’t forget to bring
back the shovels,” she added smiling. “You see I
have several brothers, and have known <em>them</em> to forget
such things, now and then.”</p>

<p>“We’ll return them, sure, before we begin our
snowball fight,” Graham answered; and soon, thanks
to Mrs. Hayes’ note, half a dozen shovels had been
handed out to the boys, who took turns at using
them, and so quickly had the walks beautifully
cleaned. Lee did his share under protest, but he did
it, and some of the boys would have done twice as
much themselves for the fun of seeing the Southern
lad obliged to handle the shovel.</p>

<p>Then the boys trooped over to the vacant lots, and
set to work to build their fort. The many hands
made short work of it, even though the fort they
fashioned was of goodly dimensions; and as soon as
it was finished, Graham and another lad carried back
the borrowed shovels. Then the two came racing
back, to take part in the choice of leaders for the
two parties.</p>

<p>A dozen names were proposed by different boys,
but finally, Hamlin and Griffin were selected. They
at once proceeded to choose their followers by first
one, and then another, calling out a name.</p>

<p>In Hamlin’s party were Clark, Gordon, Freeman,
Graham, Raleigh, Sherman and Reed, while Griffin’s
included his own friends, with Lee, Dixon, and a few<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
others. In all, there were sixty boys. The leaders
tossed up a penny for choice of position, and it fell
to Griffin and his party to hold the fort.</p>

<p>Then he and his men were allowed ten minutes to
make and carry into the fort as many snowballs as
they could, for ammunition. Meantime, Hamlin’s
party was similarly employed, while he was discussing
with one or two of them the best plan of attack.
It was decided to first make a rush all together, and
try to scale the walls all along the line. This was
done, but the attempt was a failure. The walls were
too high to be readily scaled, and such a storm of
snowballs was showered down upon the attacking
party, that Hamlin was forced to call off his men,
amid exultant shouts from those in the fort.</p>

<p>Then Hamlin divided his men into two parties,
ordering one, under Clark’s leadership, to attack one
end of the fort, while he himself led the other half
against the other end, thus obliging Griffin to divide
his force to repel the attack.</p>

<p>The two parties advanced all together against the
fort until they were quite near, then suddenly dividing,
half turned to the left and the other half to
the right. Griffin hastily sent half of his men to
repel Clark’s party, while he, with the rest, beat
back Hamlin and his followers. Again and again
the boys outside would succeed in climbing almost
to the top of the wall of snow, only to be met by a<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
shower of balls that filled eyes, ears and mouths,
while strong hands pushed and shoved them down
the slippery walls, shouts and yells of derision following
them as they descended.</p>

<p>At last, Hamlin again called off his men to rest
and gather a new stock of ammunition.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t much use, though, for us to snowball
them,” grumbled Reed, trying to get some of the
snow out of his neck. “They can throw right into
our faces when we’re climbing their walls, but we
can’t hang on to those slippery snow banks, and
throw up into their faces. They can dodge and we
can’t.”</p>

<p>“Dodge! I should say we couldn’t,” echoed Freeman.
“Much as ever I could hang on at all while
Lee was dashing snow into my face for all he was
worth.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never take that fort by direct attack,” said
Hamlin. “We’ve got to use stratagem.”</p>

<p>“Any sort of gem you say, so long as it’s a taking
sort,” responded Reed.</p>

<p>“We might tunnel under, and so let them down
unexpectedly,” suggested Clark.</p>

<p>“But they’d see us doing it,” objected Graham.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t let them,” answered Clark.</p>

<p>“What’s your idea, Clark? How would you do
it?” asked Hamlin.</p>

<p>“I’d make another attack at two points, so as to<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
divide their force, and make such a desperate fight
that Griffin would need every man he has, at those
two points. Then, while the fight was going on, one
fellow might drop down at the bottom of the fort,
and keeping below those who were climbing the
walls, so that those above in the fort couldn’t see
him, he might dig under the bottom of the wall. It
wouldn’t take many minutes for him to dig out a
hole that he could crawl into. Then he could loosen
the snow above him, so that a little extra stamping
or pushing would break the wall through and let
some of those fellows down where we could capture
them. And then we could pile up through the
opening, and so into the fort.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Gordon? Think we could do
it?” cried Hamlin eagerly.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we might, if we can find the right
chap for that burrowing trick.”</p>

<p>“If we only had a big mole here, now,” remarked
Reed.</p>

<p>“I’ll be the mole, if nobody else cares to try it,”
said Clark.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that plan will hold water,” remarked
one boy, scornfully.</p>

<p>“It’s snow we want it to hold, not water,” was
Reed’s quick response.</p>

<p>“We’ll give it a trial anyway,” said Hamlin.
“Now then&mdash;are you all ready? Well then, we’ll
go for those walls again. Forward, march!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>On went the attacking party at a full speed, while
those in the fort braced themselves to repel the
charge. Fast and furious flew the balls, and in the
cloud of snow, and amid the shouting, squirming,
struggling crowd trying to climb the walls, it was
easy for Clark to drop unnoticed at the bottom,
where he had taken care to kick out an opening as
he approached the wall. Now, using his hands in
decidedly mole-like fashion, he began to burrow
under, throwing the snow out behind him as he dug.</p>

<p>Meantime, above and around him, the struggle
went on, and so many hard knocks were given and
received, that some of the boys began to get angry.
The fun was changing to earnest.</p>

<p>Finally, Hamlin again called off his men, and as
they gathered about him, out of earshot of those in
the fort, he said to Clark:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Couldn’t carry out your plan&mdash;eh, Clark? I
was afraid it wouldn’t work.”</p>

<p>“But it did work,” said Clark, quietly.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you succeeded in undermining
the wall?” cried Hamlin, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Clark, “and it would only take a little
more digging to make it mighty unsafe for those
fellows to dance any more jigs up there.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see any opening,” said Hamlin.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I kicked some snow into the opening so
they wouldn’t discover it if any of ’em should come
outside the fort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>“Good for you, Clark,” cried Reed joyfully. “I
tell you what, Hamlin, I began to think I was getting
tired of plain fighting up there. Some of those
chaps don’t fight fair. They whack altogether too
hard about a fellow’s head.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented several.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think myself they pommeled us too
severely this last time,” said Hamlin; “but if Clark’s
plan is a success, we’ll snake ’em out of their snug
quarters before long. How do you think we’d better
go at it, Clark?”</p>

<p>“I should think it would be best to make an attack
at each end as we did last time, and while you
keep them busy so, I’ll go through my tunnel again
and pull down a little more snow under the middle.
Then I’ll back out and give a signal to let you know
I’m ready, and then both parties might drop down
and make a dash for the walls in the middle. Of
course Griffin and his men will rush there, and the
sudden rush and weight will break through what’s
left of the wall and down they’ll tumble, and up
we’ll scramble and swarm over the walls before
they can pick themselves up.”</p>

<p>“Tiptop plan,” said Gordon, and Hamlin added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll carry it out, too. Now, boys, remember&mdash;pitch
in and carry the walls if you can,
but keep your ears open for a whistle from Clark,
and when you hear it, follow me to the center.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>Derisive hoots and yells from Griffin and his men
greeted the approach of Hamlin and his party, but
the latter went steadily on in silence. Not a shout
or a cry answered the taunts of the defenders, and
again the struggle was renewed, the boys scrambling
up the walls, fighting their way inch by inch, only
to be thrust and pushed back as they neared the top.
Two did succeed in scrambling over the wall, but a
dozen strong arms seized them, and promptly rolled
them over the slippery barrier to the ground below.</p>

<p>In the midst of the struggle, a clear whistle
sounded, and at the signal, Hamlin’s voice rang out
calling his followers to retreat. They slipped down
the walls and joined their leader, but instead of retreating
as before, they instantly made a dash for
the walls in the center.</p>

<p>Griffin shouted to his men, and all but two rushed
to the threatened spot to repel the enemy. As they
did so, the walls gave way, and more than half of
the defenders rolled through the breach to the
ground, while yells and shouts of a different sort
announced their surprise and disgust at their unexpected
descent.</p>

<p>The few who had not gone down in the slump,
fought bravely, but they were quickly overpowered
by numbers, as over the walls scrambled Hamlin
and his men. It was their turn now to shout exultantly,
as they seized and made prisoner every boy<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
that they could catch. Griffin’s men looked rueful
enough as they found themselves so cleverly trapped,
and some were not only rueful, but bitterly angry.</p>

<p>“Where’s Griffin,” cried Hamlin.</p>

<p>“There he is. Catch him&mdash;catch him!” shouted
Lee, pointing to a white figure just crawling out
from under the mass of fallen snow.</p>

<p>“Surrender! Surrender!” shouted a score of voices,
as the boys surrounded Griffin.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, of course we must surrender, since
you’ve got possession of the fort; but you had to
take it by trickery&mdash;not in fair fight,” Griffin said,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“All’s fair in love and war,” quoted Graham,
gaily. “It was a perfectly fair stratagem, and certainly
a successful one, I think.”</p>

<p>“Who cares what <em>you</em> think! Take that for a last
shot!” and Griffin, losing all control of his hot temper
at these words from Graham, whom he had
never forgiven for winning the election, suddenly
raised his arm and flung a snowball he was holding
in his hand&mdash;straight at Graham’s face.</p>

<p>Clark was standing near Griffin, and as his quick
eye saw the look on the latter’s face and the sudden
movement, he sprang forward, and struck up Griffin’s
arm, and the ball, instead of knocking Graham over,
went crashing through a big window in a fine house
across the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>A change came over every face, as the rattle of
the falling glass was heard.</p>

<p>“You’re in for it, now, Grif,” said one.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t my fault. ’Twas Clark’s. What did you
knock my arm up for?” he added, turning angrily on
Clark, and looking more than half inclined to strike
him.</p>

<p>Clark did not flinch, as he answered gravely:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That ball might have hurt Graham pretty badly,
Griffin.”</p>

<p>“Hurt him! I should say so!” cried Hamlin. “A
ball that would break a window at this distance
would have killed a fellow, sure. You must have
thrown it with tremendous force, Griffin.”</p>

<p>Griffin dropped his eyes and said, sulkily:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done about it? I’ve no money
to pay for plate-glass windows, and anyway, I think
Clark’s the one to foot the bill&mdash;unless we bluff it
out. Here comes the man, now.”</p>

<p>The gentleman who was coming quickly towards
the group might have been excused for feeling that
the limit of patience was reached in his case, since
this was the third time that season that his windows
had been broken by boys playing on the vacant lots.
He was plainly very angry, as he began abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Which of you broke my window?”</p>

<p>For a second, nobody answered, and the man was
about to express his opinion pretty freely, when
Clark stepped forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>“I am partly responsible for it, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are&mdash;are you? Well, are you going to
pay for it?”</p>

<p>“It shall certainly be paid for,” Clark replied, “but
I can’t pay for it to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand that,” said the man. “You
can’t pay it to-day, and if I let you off, you <em>never</em> will
pay it. I’ll see your father about it. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Clark’s face grew suddenly white, and his clear
eyes fell, while many of those rough boys felt a
most unusual thrill of pity and sympathy for him.
But he recovered himself quickly, and answered in
a low voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have no father to pay my bills, sir, but if you
will not take my word for it, I will give you a note
to the firm I work for, and they will see that you
are paid.”</p>

<p>By this time the man’s anger had begun to cool
off a little. He was a shrewd reader of faces, and
Clark’s straightforward glance and manly air began
to make an impression on him.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>“Stanley Clark.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Stanley Clark, I suppose I’m a fool,
but I’m going to trust you. How long do you
expect me to wait for my money?”</p>

<p>“How much will the glass cost?” inquired Clark.</p>

<p>“Five dollars; the glass and the putting in. It’s
a big window, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” said Clark. “Well, sir, you shall
have the money before the first of February. Will
that do?”</p>

<p>“That will do,” and without another word the
man turned away, saying to himself, “I may be
mistaken, but I believe that young chap is honest.
Anyhow, if he doesn’t keep his word, I’ll see the
principal of the high school. They were high school
boys, and I could pick that one out among a thousand.”</p>

<p>As the man departed, all eyes were turned on
Griffin, and Hamlin voiced the feeling of many
when he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I call that right down mean and sneaky, Griffin.
It is really you who ought to pay that bill.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the man coming back again,” said Reed.
And sure enough, the man was returning, looking
at something he held in his hand, as he came.</p>

<p>Facing Clark, he demanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you throw that snowball?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Clark, “but if it hadn’t been for
me, it would probably not have gone through your
window.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the man, “I’m glad <em>you</em> didn’t throw
it, and if it was aimed at any boy’s head, that boy owes
you a debt of thanks, at least. See here; this was
inside the ball. I was so mad before that I forgot
to show it to you,” and he held out a rough, jagged<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
piece of brick. “That would have knocked the
breath out of a boy, if it had hit him full in the
face”; and leaving the brick in Clark’s hand, the
man again departed.</p>

<p>There was more than scorn and contempt now in
the eyes that turned towards Griffin, who, for the
life of him, could not help cowering under the fire of
indignant glances and the words that followed.</p>

<p>“You’d better blame Clark for knocking up your
arm,” said Hamlin, and the man crossing the street
smiled grimly as the clear, ringing voice reached
even his ears. “You might have slept behind
prison bars to-night, if it had not been for Clark’s
quick eye and hand.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have believed there was a fellow in
the Central mean enough to do a thing like that,”
added Gordon.</p>

<p>“Well, see here now, fellows.” It was Graham
who said this. “Are we going to let Clark pay that
debt for Griffin? I can’t, for one,” and the look he
gave Clark said what his tongue could not say
before all those listening ears.</p>

<p>“No! No!” shouted a score of voices.</p>

<p>“I <em>can’t</em> pay it, ’n that’s all there is about it,”
said Griffin, his hands in his pockets and his eyes on
the ground.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Many of the
boys knew that Griffin belonged to a family that had
no money to spare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Graham, “if Griffin really can’t pay
it, <em>I’m</em> the one to do it, and I will, though I can’t
do it just now. Christmas cleared me out entirely.”</p>

<p>“And me, too, of course,” said Hamlin; “that and
the school dues that I paid yesterday.”</p>

<p>“See here, boys, neither Clark nor Graham ought
to foot that bill, and I reckon we’re all pretty short
just now. Say we all chip in and earn it to-day,”
was Reed’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“Earn it, how?” cried several voices.</p>

<p>“Shoveling snow,” was the prompt reply. “This
snow is so heavy that the fellows that usually go
around to clear walks can’t begin to cover the
ground that they generally do. You see they
haven’t cleared anywhere about here yet. What’s
the matter with our borrowing shovels again over
yonder, or anywhere we can get ’em, and each of us
clearing one sidewalk. At ten cents each, we’d
raise six dollars that way in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Reed. His head’s level!” called
out one; and in two minutes not a boy was to be
seen on the vacant lots; not one except Griffin. He
stood there biting his nails, and scraping a hole in
the snow with the toe of his shoe. When the boys
passed the lots with their borrowed shovels, Griffin
was gone.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, somebody left at Hamlin’s
door twenty-five cents done up in a bit of paper, on
which was scrawled the one word, “glass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>“Griffin left that, I’m sure,” Hamlin said as he
read the word. “I’m glad he had grace enough to
do that much.”</p>

<p>He did not know that the boy had earned that
quarter clearing off snow with a shovel that he had
manufactured himself out of a broom-handle and a
piece of a soap-box. Even Griffin was not all bad.</p>

<p>A much astonished gentleman was the one who
was called to his door that evening to meet a delegation
of high-school boys, one of whom handed him
a five-dollar bill to pay for his broken window.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HONOR TO WHOM HONOR IS DUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One morning, St. John, on his way to the class-room,
stopped before a bulletin-board on which had
been written the names of the institutions offering
scholarships to the pupils of the high school.</p>

<p>He had overheard an occasional word about these
scholarships, but really knew very little about them.
So he stood there reading the list.</p>

<p>Then up the stairs behind him came half a dozen
boys of section D. As they caught sight of St.
John, they, too, stopped to see what he was reading.
St. John, who seemed never to want any boy within
a yard of him, turned to go, but, with a mischievous
glance at the other, Reed stood still, and the others
pressed closely together, penning St. John in to the
little space between them and the board. Seeing
their purpose, St. John’s face took on its haughtiest
expression, and leaning against the board, he waited
in angry silence for them to move aside and let him
pass. But they, enjoying his discomfiture, stood
laughing and chaffing one another, but never saying
a word to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>More and more boys joined the group, and, each
one taking in the situation, stood there as if he had
no intention of going farther that day.</p>

<p>Finally Dixon called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Say, boys, who’s going to take these prizes?”
glancing at the board.</p>

<p>“Gordon&mdash;Clark&mdash;Hamlin&mdash;Raleigh,” shouted
the crowd.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Reed, thoughtfully, “they’re the only
ones that have the ghost of a chance.”</p>

<p>“But they can’t take ’em all,” somebody suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, the girls have a go at two of them.
Aren’t you going to give the girls a chance?” said
Dixon.</p>

<p>“We didn’t say that those fellows would accept
the scholarships&mdash;but they’ll <em>win</em> ’em sure.” This
from Barber.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Reed, with one eye on St. John’s
angry face, “they’ll win ’em sure, and they ought
to. They’ve worked hard enough for them, and
they deserve all they’ll win. The rest of us must
play second fiddle this year. Not but what second
fiddle is pretty fair, when it puts a chap up in the
nineties.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Bobby!”</p>

<p>The word ran through the crowd, and the group
dissolved like magic, leaving St. John free to enter
the class-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>Of course he knew that the boys had only been
trying to tease him, for his high rank in the class
could not be denied; but all the same it made him
furiously angry to be ranked with the “second
fiddles,” and counted out entirely in the prize competition.</p>

<p>All but one of the six scholarships were to be
given to the pupils having highest averages in all or
in certain studies, during the three years’ course;
but one, and that the highest prize&mdash;or the one
so considered in the school&mdash;was offered to the boy
who should rank first in the classical course during
the senior year, and should also write the best Latin
essay. If, as had sometimes happened, two or three
boys should stand equally high on the year’s average,
then the quality of their essays would decide
to whom the prize should go. But if one boy
should stand first in the class, and another not
ranking as high should hand in a better essay&mdash;for
any boy who chose was free to compete&mdash;then the
prize would not be given at all that year.</p>

<p>“I’ll win that scholarship if it kills me to do it,
just to make that crowd mad. It <em>would</em> make them
mad enough to see their precious four worsted in
the fight. And they <em>shall</em> see it, sure as fate!”</p>

<p>So ran St. John’s thoughts during that morning’s
exercises. From that day, this one thought and purpose
ruled him. He had never cared for athletic<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
sports, and riding and driving were all the exercise
he ever took, but now, the time spent in going to
and from school was all that he was out of doors;
and almost every moment of his waking time was
given to study. Long after midnight he worked,
going over and over what he already knew, lest
possibly, some point might have been forgotten or
slighted.</p>

<p>The other four boys were working hard too, but
they were so accustomed to out-of-door sports
and exercise, that it never occurred to them that
they could give them up. So they kept their brains
and bodies in good working order, while St. John
grew, week by week, more worn and weary.</p>

<p>“His royal highness looks rather seedy&mdash;eh,”
Reed said one day to Clark, and the latter answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think he’s working too hard.”</p>

<p>St. John’s ears, sharpened by his nervous anxiety,
caught both question and answer, and resented anyone’s
thinking that he needed to work harder than
any of the others. Up to this time he had been
coldly indifferent to his classmates, but now he began
to hate them all. He told himself that they
were all banded against him, and that not one of
them wanted him to win. And this was true. He
had made not the slightest effort to gain their friendship,
while the others were all prime favorites.<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
Even Clark was happily conscious that the boys
were friendly to him now; all except St. John
and Lee. Lee’s Southern prejudice had not yet
died away, and in his heart he still regarded Clark
as a coward.</p>

<p>The competition for the prize scholarships was
not confined to section D. There were two girls’
sections, and one other boys’ section in the senior
year, and in each of these there were scholars who
were quite as eager to win the prizes as were the
boys in section D.</p>

<p>And in section D also there were other competitors
besides the five who stood highest in the class.
These were what Reed had called the “second fiddles,”
and their chance lay in the fact that neither
St. John, Gordon, nor Hamlin would accept the
scholarships, should they win them, as all three of
them were planning to enter some of the larger and
more prominent colleges. They wanted the honor
of winning the prizes, but it was generally understood
that the prizes themselves would go to the
next lower in class, while the whole class to a boy,
always excepting St. John, was now determined
that D should be the banner section this year.
None were more eager for this last than Crawford
and Freeman. Both of them were trying to live
down the previous year’s record. They could hope
to win no prizes, but they could do their share<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
towards raising the general record, and this they
were trying to do.</p>

<p>As the sunny May days slipped away and examination
time approached, the strain of the competition
began to tell upon many of the pupils. Four in
section D stood so nearly together that Mr. Horton
himself could not see that one had any better chance
than the others.</p>

<p>“I never had four such students in one class,” he
said to Professor Keene one day. “So far as perfect
recitations go, there is nothing to choose between
them. When St. John first entered, he was away
ahead in Latin, but the other three have been
steadily overtaking him, and now it all rests on the
examinations.”</p>

<p>“And the Latin essay,” added the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes. That, of course, decides one prize.”</p>

<p>“St. John going to win there?” questioned the
professor.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton shook his head doubtfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the lad is not well,” he said. “I notice
that he doesn’t think as quickly as he did, and one
of the others may write a better essay. His will be
couched in elegant Latin, but the matter of it may
not be equal to some one of the others. There’s no
telling; anyhow, it is going to be a very close contest,
and I shall be glad when it is over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so shall I,” responded the professor. “There’s<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
always more or less ill-feeling, and too great strain
in these prize competitions.”</p>

<p>A carriage stood before the schoolhouse gate when
school was dismissed that day. A lady and little
girl sat within it, watching the throng of boys passing
down the steps.</p>

<p>“There’s Charlie, Mamma! Charlie! Charlie!”
called the child’s clear voice, as Reed, with Hamlin
and Clark, came down the steps.</p>

<p>Reed hurried to the carriage, but his mother was
looking not at him, but at one of the other two.</p>

<p>“Who is that boy, Charlie&mdash;the one that you
were talking to?” she cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>Reed paused, with his hand on the carriage door.</p>

<p>“That’s Clark&mdash;Stanley Clark. You’ve heard me
speak of him times enough,” he answered, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlie, that is the boy that saved Nellie’s
life. Don’t let him get away. Bring him here
quick. I <em>must</em> speak to him.”</p>

<p>With a mixture of delight and amazement on his
face, Reed raced after the two boys, and seizing
Clark by the arm, cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come, Clark, my mother wants to see you. You
<em>must</em> come,” he added imperatively, as Clark held
back, unwillingly. “I’ll tell you what it’s all about
to-morrow, Hamlin”; and he began to pull Clark
toward the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>Clark knew why he was wanted, for he had
recognized the two, but he would far rather have
risked his life again than to have been marched up
to that carriage. But there was no help for it, so he
submitted with the best grace possible.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed seized both his hands, and her eyes
were dim as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To think that it was you who saved my little girl,
and all this time we have never suspected it! You
<em>must</em> have seen our advertisements?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Clark, looking mightily uncomfortable,
“but I didn’t want any more thanks, you
know. Any fellow would have done what I did on
the impulse of the moment. If I’d stopped to think,
I should probably have stood still.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Mrs. Reed promptly. “A
boy who acted on such an impulse as you did,
<em>couldn’t</em> be a coward. It is not in him. But step
in; we’ll take you home. I must know where you
live, for I want to call on your mother. I know she
was proud of her boy that night.”</p>

<p>Clark laughed a little. “No,” he said, “she
never knew anything about it, except what she read
in the paper.”</p>

<p>“Well, she <em>will</em> know about it to-morrow,” said the
little lady decidedly.</p>

<p>When the carriage stopped at Clark’s door, she
again took the lad’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>“Think what a shadow would be upon our home
to-day, but for you,” she said, with a glance at her
little daughter. “It is a debt that we can never repay,
but, at least, let us have the pleasure of seeing
you and your mother sometimes, at our home. I
have often asked Charlie why you never came to
our house, as so many of the other boys do; I know
the reason, now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clark wondered a little when her son told
her that Charlie Reed’s mother would call upon her
the next day. She was not at all pleased, since she
was living in the utmost seclusion, feeling almost as
keenly as did her son the cloud of disgrace that
rested upon them. But when she learned from Mrs.
Reed what Stanley had done, when she saw the
tears of deep feeling in the eyes of her visitor, and
felt the warm pressure of her hands, how could she
help being proud and happy?</p>

<p>Clark would have liked to stay away from school
that next day, but it would never do to bring down
his record by an absent mark. He went as late as he
dared, however, but the instant he entered the room
he saw that the boys were waiting for him, and in
spite of the fact that Mr. Horton was already at his
desk, a shout broke from the whole class at sight of
the schoolmate, whom they were now as eager to
honor as a year ago they had been to hurt and
annoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“Three cheers for Clark!” shouted the irrepressible
Reed, actually jumping up on his seat in his
excitement, and the cheers were given with a will,
while Clark, blushing and confused, bowed his
thanks and dropped hastily into his seat.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Mr. Horton, looking slowly
about the room, “may I ask what this means?
What have you been doing, Clark, to awaken all
this enthusiasm?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, sir. It’s just the boys,” stammered
Clark.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Horton dryly, “I’m quite aware
that it was just the boys.” But now Reed, trying to
keep his enthusiasm within bounds, told the story
in a few graphic words.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton listened with as great an interest as
even Reed could desire, and when the story was
ended, said only:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Boys, you are perfectly excusable for this
once; only remember that this is not a precedent,”
but the look he gave the quiet lad whom he had
learned to love, assured the boys that their teacher
was in fullest sympathy with them.</p>

<p>From this time, Clark’s popularity in the school
was very great. Even hot-headed Lee blotted from
his memory that unreturned blow, the year before,
and not even in the depths of his own heart did he
ever again call Stanley Clark “coward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>Before that day was over, section D had another
sensation.</p>

<p>As usual near the close of the year, the rules were
relaxed, especially in the senior class, and often some
of the boys would remain in the room during part of
the recess, talking over their work and surmising
about the questions likely to be asked in the examinations.
Half a dozen or more were busily talking
about the dreaded Latin essays, when Reed came
rushing upstairs, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I say, you fellows, you missed a picnic, staying
in to-day. Didn’t you hear us all yelling outside?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, we heard you, but it’s nothing unusual
for you little chaps to be noisy,” said Hamlin, loftily.
Then he added, “but if you’re very anxious to tell us
what it was about, this time, we can listen, I suppose,”
and with an air of patient endurance, he
dropped into his seat.</p>

<p>Reed picked up a book and flung it at him, but he
was too full of his story to pursue the mock quarrel,
especially as two or three voices called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Go on, Reedy&mdash;tell us what ’twas all about.”</p>

<p>“Why, we were all out there on the sidewalk&mdash;a
whole crowd of us,” said Reed, “when a fellow came
along driving a heavy cart with the worst-looking
old rackabones of a horse you ever laid eyes on. The
creature didn’t look as if it had had a good meal in
six months, and it was so weak that it could hardly<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
crawl. Just before it got opposite our gate, the horse
stopped, and the big brute that was driving began to
lash it unmercifully&mdash;to get past us, I expect.</p>

<p>“Some of us yelled at him to ‘hold up,’ but, bless
you, before the words were fairly out of our mouths,
Crawford had dashed out and was pitching into that
driver, and giving him as pretty a pommeling as
you’d want to see; put him right down there in
the street and licked him well. Then he yanked
him up, and ordered him to take the horse out of
the shafts. The fellow refused at first, and threatened
to ‘have the law’ on Crawford; but that didn’t scare
Crawford a bit, and then the rascal began to whine
and swear by turns; and finally asked how he could
get his cart home without the horse.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll fix that,’ said Crawford, ‘but that horse is
going to have a rest for one week, and all he wants
to eat, and he’s going to have ’em in the stable where
my horses are kept.’</p>

<p>“‘An’ phwat will I be doin’ ahl that week, with
niver a hoss to me cart?’ said the man.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll hire a horse for you to use that week,’ said
Crawford.</p>

<p>“The man looked at him.</p>

<p>“‘An’ phwat if I say No?’ said he, looking as if
he would like to give Crawford a black eye, if he
dared.</p>

<p>“‘Then I’ll go this moment, and enter a complaint<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
against you. Any officer of the Humane Society
would order that poor brute killed rather than see
him driven as he is now, to say nothing of seeing
him beaten as shamefully as you beat him just now,’
said Crawford.</p>

<p>“The man looked around at us all. Of course,
we’d crowded ’round to see the thing out&mdash;and then
he began slowly to unfasten the poor old nag. It
was so weak that I thought it would have to be
propped up against a fence or something, but it did
manage to stand.</p>

<p>“‘Now phwere’ll I take him?’ said the man, and I
know he added some hot words under his breath.</p>

<p>“‘You’ll come along with me,’ said Crawford.
‘I’m not going to trust that horse out of my sight’;
and I just wish you’d seen ’em going up the street
together, almost holding up that poor old skeleton
between ’em, with a crowd of street boys who had
gathered, tagging on behind, hooting and yelling.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i253.jpg" alt="Confrontation over horse." />
</div>

<p>As Reed stopped to take breath, Gordon exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, I’d never have believed that of Crawford.
I didn’t think he was that sort at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he loves horses,” broke in Freeman. “You
ought to see him pet those ponies of his. I heard
him say once, that his ponies were all the <em>folks</em> he
had, for his nearest relative is a cousin that he hasn’t
seen in ten years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>A sudden silence followed Freeman’s words, and
more than one boy’s thoughts flew to his own home
and those who loved him there, and a new feeling of
sympathy for Crawford was awakened.</p>

<p>“Section D should be proud of Crawford, to-day,”
said Clark. “Let’s show him that we are.”</p>

<p>“So we will,” said one and another.</p>

<p>“But won’t Mr. Horton mark him off for breaking
bounds?” said Dixon, as the bell sounded.</p>

<p>“Not he; trust Bobby to do the fair thing when
he hears the story,” said Graham, and Reed added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bobby’s all right. Crawford asked me to tell
him, and he said it would be all right.”</p>

<p>But for Mr. Horton’s warning in regard to a precedent,
Crawford would have received almost as enthusiastic
a greeting when he returned half an hour
later as had been given to Clark that morning; but,
as it was, he slipped quietly into his seat, and the
boys only showed their appreciation of the stand
he had taken, by surrounding him after school, and
asking all sorts of questions about the affair. From
this time however, Crawford was “counted in” to
whatever was going on, as he never had been before.</p>

<p>In the midst of the strain of approaching examinations,
and essays to be prepared, came the annual
drill, and though our senior boys had felt, a few
weeks before, as if they could hardly spare the time
for the extra drilling, yet, after all, Company D <em>did</em><span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
want to keep those red ribbons one more year, and
every other company wanted just as much to capture
them and that beautiful gold medal; and so, when
the great day came, lessons took a second place for
once, and the boys in blue came to the front.</p>

<p>This time, there was no disorder, and no unfair
dealing. The judges gave high praise to the battalion
as a body, and Company D retained the red ribbons.
It was the last company on the list, and when, with
the little silken badges fluttering in the breeze, it
marched off the field, all the other companies united
in a cordial cheer for Company D; which unexpected
demonstration from the disappointed competitors so
pleased Captain Hamlin that, the next day, every
boy in the battalion received an invitation to a
steamboat trip down the bay, with a shore dinner&mdash;all
at the expense of Company D, though Hamlin
himself paid the bill. And if he thereby deprived
himself of a special pleasure trip that his father had
promised him, the boys never knew it, and Hamlin
was content.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GLADNESS FOR CLARK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Who enters here, leaves hope behind.”</p>

<p>This legend, in huge, shaded letters, adorned the
blackboard one morning, when a written examination
in geometry was to take the place of the usual
recitations.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton glanced at Dixon with a smile as he
read the sentence, for Dixon was apt to get badly
tangled up over those perplexing lines and angles,
and was always in the depths of melancholy when
an examination in geometry was impending.</p>

<p>Just then Dixon was saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wish I could borrow your head this morning,
Clark. You wouldn’t mind lending it, would you?”</p>

<p>Clark, buried in the depths of a big lexicon, answered
in an absent-minded way:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Help yourself.”</p>

<p>The shout of laughter from the boys who had
heard both question and answer brought Clark back
to his surroundings, and he joined in the laugh
against himself, while Dixon grumbled:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Only wish I could hold him to his word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>When inkwells had been filled, pens and paper
distributed, and the boys were taking last, lingering
peeps at the knottiest theorems before their geometries
should be collected, as was the custom, they
were taken entirely by surprise, for, instead of telling
two boys to bring the books to the desk, the
teacher said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Boys, we are going to carry the self-government
principles into the examinations this year. If you
will all promise to be perfectly fair and honorable
in this examination, your books may remain on
your desks, and I shall leave the room without a
monitor until the examination is over. As many as
would like me to do this will please rise.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Mr. Horton that every boy in the
room was on his feet the next instant. In reality,
several rose slowly, and only because they were not
willing to say that they preferred not to be so
trusted.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton looked much pleased, as he bade the
boys be seated.</p>

<p>“I am <em>very</em> glad to have such an unanimous
response,” he said, “and I shall leave you without
the slightest doubt. I know that my boys can be
trusted this year, and it is a pleasure to me to show
you how thoroughly I do trust you. Now, has any
one any question to ask about the examination
before I leave the room?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>After answering a few questions, Mr. Horton
went out, and the boys settled down to work. To
many of them, it seemed strange to be left so.
These were the boys who had been used to whisper,
and take sly peeps at bits of paper which they had
tucked into various pockets. More than one had
such aids to memory about him at that very moment,
but they were ashamed, now, to use them.</p>

<p>As the boys looked over the list of questions,
many a sigh or frown showed that that list contained
precisely the questions that one or another
had hoped would not be there.</p>

<p>But most of the boys settled down at once to
steady work, and for a while nothing was heard but
the scratching of pens and the rattling of paper, or
the uneasy movements of some lad who was trying
in vain to recall a forgotten theorem.</p>

<p>As Gordon laid aside a written sheet, he happened
to glance towards a seat occupied by Blake&mdash;one of
the boys who had entered that year, and he saw
Blake softly lift the lid of his desk, and peep at
something on the inside.</p>

<p>Leaving his seat, Gordon marched directly to
Blake’s, and, without a word, suddenly lifted the lid
of his desk, in spite of the other’s efforts to prevent
it On the inside of the lid was pinned a brief explanation
of several of the toughest problems in the
geometry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>With a look of scorn in his blue eyes, Gordon
snatched the paper and tore it into bits; then, still
without a word, he returned to his seat. As he did
so, several boys, whose quick eyes had taken note of
the whole performance, clapped their approval, and
at this, Blake, who had started up angrily, dropped
back into his seat, and went on with his work in
sulky silence.</p>

<p>One or two other boys attempted to cheat that
day, but their attempts were put down by the rest as
promptly as Blake’s had been.</p>

<p>Blake tried to slip out of the room unnoticed
after the examination was over, but Gordon had
kept an eye on him, and speedily overtook him in
the hall.</p>

<p>“Blake,” he said, “I’m sure you are glad, now, that
you did your work honestly. You wouldn’t have
liked Mr. Horton to know that you went back
on your word.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have known it, if you’d minded
your own business,” growled Blake, “and I should
have had a hundred on the examination, and now I
shan’t get above eighty, thanks to your meddling.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, Blake, but I’d rather have an
honest eighty than a dishonest hundred, and I’m
sure Mr. Horton would say so, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re too high-toned in this school,” said
Blake. “I never was in a school before where we<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
didn’t cheat in examinations. The teachers wink at
it. They know we do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe in it,” said Gordon. “I
mean to be honest after I leave school, and I don’t
see why I shouldn’t be honest in school, too. I
couldn’t respect myself, if I did mean, underhanded
things.”</p>

<p>“Respect your grandmother!” muttered Blake,
walking off at such a pace that Gordon did not attempt
to keep up with him, but turned back to wait
for Hamlin, who came down the stairs a moment
later.</p>

<p>Hamlin was looking very happy.</p>

<p>“Such a relief to get that exam. over,” he said, as
he joined Gordon; “and I knew every problem like
a book. Wasn’t it fine, though, to have Bobby put
the class on honor so!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gordon, “though two or three didn’t
live up to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not. There are always a few
sneaks in every crowd, but on the whole they did
splendidly, I think. But what’s the matter with
St. John?”</p>

<p>“Matter? What do you mean?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s still pegging away up there, and
usually he’s one of the first to finish up,” replied
Hamlin.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you noticed how much slower he’s been<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
lately than he was the first of the year? I think
the fellow’s worked out,” said Gordon. “Too bad,
too, for it will spoil his whole year’s record, if he
doesn’t get through these exams. in good shape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get through all right enough,” said
Hamlin, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Who else was up there when you left?” asked
Gordon.</p>

<p>“Only Dixon, Freeman, Lee and Clark. Clark had
handed in his paper and was waiting for Freeman.
Here they come now.” And the two boys stopped
and waited for the other two.</p>

<p>“Bobby certainly is working the self-government
plan for all it is worth to-day,” said Freeman, as he
and Clark joined the others.</p>

<p>“Anything new?” asked Hamlin.</p>

<p>“He’s left those three, St. John, Lee and Dixon,
up there in the room to finish, and told ’em to put
their papers in the lower drawer in his desk when
they get through; and the last one is to lock the
drawer and give him the key in the morning.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is putting them on honor,” said
Gordon; “but I guess it’s safe enough with those
three fellows.”</p>

<p>The three boys left in the class-room worked on
in silence for half an hour. Then Lee had finished
his work, and putting his paper in the drawer, he
departed, followed a few minutes later by Dixon.<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
Both boys cast wondering glances at St. John, who
was usually among the first to pass in his papers,
but he paid no attention to them, not seeming even
to notice when they left the room.</p>

<p>He had finished all but one of the problems
given. That one he had tried in vain to solve. His
tired brain would not recall the theorem required.
As Dixon left the room, St. John dropped his head
on his desk with a weary sigh, but in a moment he
started up again, and bent over the question-paper.</p>

<p>“Why <em>can’t</em> I think of it?” he said half aloud.
“Of course I know it. I’ve solved that problem no
end of times.”</p>

<p>His eye fell on his geometry. He stretched his
hand towards it, then drew it back, a hot flush burning
on his cheek.</p>

<p>“On honor!” he murmured, and pushing the book
aside, he tried again to think out the solution required,
but in vain. For half an hour he sat there
fighting against the temptation that assailed him.
Once he folded his unfinished paper, and started to
put it in the drawer; then, remembering how Gordon,
Clark and Hamlin had gone off an hour before&mdash;with
every question correctly answered, he was
sure&mdash;he dropped back into his seat with a groan.</p>

<p>“I <em>can’t</em> let them get ahead of me, so,” he
thought. “I’m really a better scholar than anyone
of the lot. It’s just that my head is so dead tired<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>!
I really do know every page of that geometry, if I
only could think of it&mdash;if <em>only</em> I could.”</p>

<p>But he could not, try as he would. Then the
janitor looked in at the door, and St. John knew
that he wanted to clean the room. He began
wearily to put away his papers. Suddenly he
reached forward, snatched his geometry, and hurriedly
turning the leaves, looked at the theorem that
he had been trying to recall. Then, flinging the
book aside, he hastily wrote out the explanation on
his examination paper, folded it, and flung it carelessly
into the drawer, and, forgetting entirely that
he was to lock the drawer and keep the key until
morning, he picked up his cap and left the room.
His paper was all right, he was sure, but already
he felt that he had paid too high a price for it.</p>

<p>The examinations that followed were conducted
on the same principle as this first one, and Mr. Horton
was so well satisfied with the result that he
determined that he would never go back to the old
watching method again. The Latin examination
was held the next week, and, so far as was known,
not one boy attempted underhanded methods.</p>

<p>St. John was so thoroughly at home in Latin, that
he was among the first to complete his work, and
he left the room with a sigh of relief that one more
task was over, for he had reached that stage of mental
and physical exhaustion when the smallest task<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
seems a load too heavy to be borne, and he was
gathering all his energies to finish the Latin essay
that was to decide who should hold first rank in the
class.</p>

<p>For weeks he had been working at that essay,
writing and rewriting; one day pleased with his
work, the next so dissatisfied that he would throw
it aside and begin anew. But now, the time was
short, and in a few days the essay must be handed
in to the judges.</p>

<p>Gordon, Hamlin and Clark were also more than a
little concerned about their essays.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the putting it into Latin; it’s getting the
ideas in English that sticks me,” Hamlin said to
Clark one day. “I’ve been cudgeling my brains, and
it does seem as if I haven’t an idea worth writing
down, on any subject whatever.”</p>

<p>“Queer, how a fellow’s ideas do vanish the minute
he tries to write ’em out on paper,” said Clark.
“I couldn’t get to sleep the other night for thinking
about that essay, and while I lay awake, I thought
of a subject, and one idea after another came to me,
till I jumped out of bed and went to scribbling.
Then I went back to bed and to sleep, and in the
morning, when I read over my bright ideas, they
seemed just about as near nothing as anything I
ever read. So I flung the whole thing into the
waste-basket, and began over again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve begun about a dozen times, and all my
efforts, thus far, seem to me to be fit for the same
receptacle,” laughed Gordon; “but there’s so little
time left, that all I can do is to pick out the best of
the lot&mdash;if there is any best&mdash;and make a smooth
copy of it, and let it go at that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’ll do for you to say,” grumbled
Hamlin; “but all the same you’ll hand in an essay
all trimmed up and polished off in tip-top style.
That’s what you’ll both do. I know you two chaps;
seen you before.”</p>

<p>Any boy in the Latin class was free to hand in
an essay in competition for the prize scholarship;
but it was well enough understood who were the six
sure to stand at the head of the class, and there was
small likelihood that any other boy could produce a
better essay than any one of these six could write.
Nevertheless, a few made the attempt, and nine essays
were given to the judges. The decision was
not to be made known, however, until Commencement
day; so, when their papers had been handed
in, the boys tried to forget all about the matter
until the decision should be announced.</p>

<p>The day before Commencement was always one
of intense interest, because then the results of all
the examinations were announced, and not till then
could the scholars know their marks on the whole
year’s work, and for those who had been in the<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
school through the entire three years, their standing
for the whole period. Those who hoped to win
one of the scholarships were especially anxious to
know their standing, to see what their chances
might be.</p>

<p>Rules were relaxed on this day. There were no
more recitations. The work of the senior year was
ended, and this last day was really more in the nature
of a final friendly meeting as a class, than anything
else.</p>

<p>When Mr. Horton, who had been down to Prof.
Keene’s office, returned to his class-room with a
paper in his hand, the merry chatter ceased, and
the boys dropped into their seats, prepared to give
him their undivided attention.</p>

<p>He began by telling them that never since he
had been teaching had he had a class that had done,
on the whole, so satisfactory work as this class had
done during the past year. He spoke of the marked
improvement, both in scholarship and moral character
of the class as a whole, and told them that their
influence had not been confined to their own section,
but had extended to the whole school, so that Prof.
Keene declared that the school stood much higher
in reputation than it had done a year ago. “And he
attributes this,” said Mr. Horton, “to the influence
of the Law and Order Society of section D.”</p>

<p>A round of applause greeted this, but it was quickly
hushed, as the teacher went on:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>“It gives me much pleasure to say, as it will give
you to hear, that section D is the banner section of
the Central, this year.”</p>

<p>The applause that followed this announcement was
so enthusiastic and prolonged that it reached the ears
of Prof. Keene, in his office, but he only smiled as he
listened.</p>

<p>But Mr. Horton raised his hand, and silence instantly
succeeded, for the boys were longing to know
what was written on that paper which he held, and
now he unfolded it, and read the result of the examinations.</p>

<p class="il1">
Number 1. Stanley Clark.<br />
Number 2. Hugh Gordon, and Everett St. John.<br />
Number 3. David Hamlin.<br />
Number 4. Alec Graham, and so on.<br />
</p>

<p>Each name was greeted with a round of cheers,
and as soon as the list was ended, the boys crowded
around the prize-winners with congratulations. Only
St. John sat apart, and spoke to nobody. To stand
second was nothing to him. If he could not stand
first, he said to himself that he might as well be at
the bottom of the list; and besides, deep in his heart,
he knew that he had not gained honestly even the
second rank. So he answered coldly, even rudely,
the congratulations of Clark and Hamlin, and intimated
so plainly that he wanted to be let alone,
that no one else ventured to approach him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the hubbub of talk, Mr. Horton
called Reed to the desk.</p>

<p>“You are wanted in the professor’s office,” he said.</p>

<p>Wondering “what was up,” Reed hurried down to
the office. When, half an hour later, he returned, his
face was fairly radiant. A tall, fine-looking gentleman
followed him, and the whisper went around that
that was Charlie Reed’s father.</p>

<p>Reed did not go to his own seat, but slipped into
one beside Clark, and, as he did so, he seized Clark’s
hand and wrung it till the latter fairly winced, as
he whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter, Reed?”</p>

<p>But Reed, with that same happy smile, answered
only:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Father’s going to make a speech. You just listen.”</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Reed, who had been talking
to Mr. Horton, rose and faced the boys.</p>

<p>“I have a story to tell,” he began; “a story in
which, I am sure, you will all be interested, as it
deeply concerns one of your number. It is a true
story&mdash;true in every detail.</p>

<p>“In a neighboring city there lived, not long ago,
a man who stood very high in the community. He
was wealthy, he held positions of trust&mdash;of honor,
and no man in the land seemed less likely to fall
than he; yet he <em>did</em> fall. Not satisfied with the<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
wealth and station he had gained, he wanted to
double his millions. He speculated&mdash;risked all
that he had, and lost. Then he used the trust-funds
in his hands, and again he lost.</p>

<p>“Then, with wealth gone, with honor gone, he
would have taken his own life, but for one thing.
His wife was very, very ill, and she had no one in
the world but him, for they had no children.</p>

<p>“While he sat in his office, trying to decide
whether he could leave his dying wife alone in the
world, and commit this last great crime, there came
to him one who was associated with him in business,
one to whom he had years before given a helping
hand. This man had never forgotten the help
he had received, and the other knew that he could
count upon help and sympathy from him in this
hour of his shame and trouble.</p>

<p>“He told his friend the whole story, and asked of
him what I believe no man has a right to ask of another.
It could be made to appear to the world as if
this other were the one who had betrayed his trust,
and the guilty man proposed to let the world believe
this. He asked his friend to bear in his stead the
shame and dishonor that rightfully belonged to himself.</p>

<p>“‘It is only for a few days,’ he pleaded. ‘You
know how <em>very</em> ill my poor wife is. The doctors
say it is a question of but a few hours now. It is<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
only for her sake&mdash;that she may die in peace&mdash;and,
as soon as she is gone, the world shall know the
whole story, and your name shall be fully cleared.’</p>

<p>“That was an awful sacrifice to ask of an upright,
honorable man.</p>

<p>“At first the man refused utterly, but the other
reminded him of past kindness received not only
from himself, but from the wife whose life was so
near its end&mdash;and at last he yielded. He agreed
to bear the blame and the shame for the little time
she had to live, only making the condition that his
own wife should know the truth.</p>

<p>“Think, boys, what it was to that man to have
the papers full of the story, to see friends pass him
coldly by&mdash;even when he believed that in a few
days all would be made right again!</p>

<p>“But, contrary to all expectations, the apparently
dying woman rallied, and slowly, very slowly, began
to recover.</p>

<p>“Then, what was to be done? The guilty man
selfishly refused to own the truth, and clear the
name of his friend, and that friend was obliged to
leave the country, or go to prison and serve a sentence
for a crime he had never committed.</p>

<p>“He went to another land, and there devoted his
time and strength to winning back enough to repay
all that had been lost through his partner’s sin.</p>

<p>“A few days ago, the invalid wife died&mdash;died in
blissful ignorance of the sad truth. When she was<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
gone, all interest in life for her husband was ended.
He felt that he could no longer bear the burden of
his own guilt, and the knowledge of what another
was suffering through him. He told the whole
story, gave up every dollar he had left, and only
asked that the name of the noble man who had suffered
shame for his sake be cleared at once.</p>

<p>“The papers, to-night, will tell the story to all the
world, and from this day forth no shadow will ever
rest on the name of Stanley W. Clark.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense silence as Mr.
Reed ceased speaking. Then came a perfect burst
of cheers.</p>

<p>Clark’s face was buried in his hands, and when he
lifted it to see Mr. Reed standing beside him, the
glad tears were rolling down his cheeks, and more
than one boy found his own eyes dim.</p>

<p>As for Charlie Reed&mdash;he declared that he was
“’most too happy to live.”</p>

<p>All through the year Clark had been winning his
way into the hearts of his schoolmates, and now
they went wild over him, and shook his hands till
his arms were lame, and showed so much sympathy
and gladness for him, that, at last, he broke down
entirely, and cried like a baby for pure joy.</p>

<p>From that day no shadow rested on his strong
young face, and never again did he need to shrink
from others, or dread a reference to the father who
was, more than ever, his ideal.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">COMMENCEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next day was Commencement.</p>

<p>A brief, informal session was held in the morning,
but it was a session from which none wished to
be absent, for then the names of the prize-winners
were to be announced.</p>

<p>There were many anxious hearts, and a few hopeful
ones, for though the rank-list read the day
before told each boy his standing in class, it did
not settle the matter of the prize scholarships.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that only one boy grudged Stanley
Clark the first rank that he had so fairly won by
his steady, thorough work. That boy was Everett
St. John. He would not have been present at all,
that morning, but for the Latin essays. He had
still a lingering hope that his might be adjudged the
best.</p>

<p>But now Mr. Horton was writing on the blackboard,
and every boy gazed eagerly forward to read
what was written. In his clear hand, they read the
names of the six colleges offering the scholarships.
Then, with the chalk in his fingers, he faced the
school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>“You all heard the rank-list read yesterday,” he
said, “so you know that Clark, St. John and Gordon
would have the first claim on the second, third and
fourth of these scholarships, but as these three are
to enter other colleges, these scholarships go to the
next in rank, Graham, Griffin and Bent; the two
last named being members, as you know, of section
A.</p>

<p>“The last two scholarships on the list have, I am
happy to say, been won by girls. And now there
remains but one&mdash;the first&mdash;which will be
awarded to the boy whose Latin thesis has been
considered by the judges to be the best. That
thesis I hold in my hand, but I do not know what
name it bears, as it was handed to me in this sealed
envelope.”</p>

<p>Every eye watched as he tore open the envelope
and read the name of Stanley Clark, and hearty
cheers expressed the satisfaction of his classmates
at the result.</p>

<p>As soon as he could secure silence, Mr. Horton
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The judges desire me to say that they have
awarded the prize to Stanley Clark because of the
high character of his essay, and they also wish me
to state that, in elegance of style and choice of words,
the essay submitted by Everett St. John is decidedly
superior.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[268]</span></p>

<p>It was Clark who led applause for St. John, but
the latter only scowled in response to it. His pride
and ambition were too bitterly hurt to appreciate any
expression of kindly feeling.</p>

<p>“There is one more prize to be given this year,”
Mr. Horton went on, taking a small case from his
desk. “It is a gold medal which has never been
given before, but the donor has made it a perpetual
gift from this time. It is to be given to the boy in
the senior class who has made the greatest advance
in moral character during the year. Of course, we
can only judge from what we see, and therefore this
is the most difficult prize to award; so you, to whom
the decision is left, must think carefully before you
decide. This is to be awarded by vote of the class.
I should have added that, by express desire of the
gentleman who gives this prize, it is to be, this year,
awarded to some member of section D. After this
year, it is not to be so limited.”</p>

<p>The boys looked wonderingly at one another.
They did not quite like the responsibility laid upon
them.</p>

<p>“May I speak to some of the boys, sir?” Clark
asked, and as Mr. Horton gave assent, he quickly
turned to Hamlin, and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think Crawford ought to have it, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hamlin, promptly. “I had thought of
Freeman, but though he has improved immensely<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
this year, he hasn’t made such a jump as Crawford,
because he never got so far down.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure it will help Crawford to know how
we feel about it,” suggested Clark.</p>

<p>From one to another the suggestion passed, and,
when Mr. Horton called for the decision, it was almost
an unanimous one for Crawford. He was taken
utterly by surprise. Not one thought of the possibility
of its being awarded to him had entered his
mind, and he was prepared to vote most heartily for
Freeman; but he was honestly pleased to know that
his efforts to “do the square thing,” as he would
have expressed it, had been appreciated, and that
shining gold medal was a constant incentive to fresh
effort thereafter. It was many a year before he discovered
that it was his stern guardian, Mr. Chase,
who had given this prize, earnestly hoping that
Crawford would be the winner.</p>

<p>The Commencement exercises were held in the
evening in one of the largest opera-houses.</p>

<p>Never had the decorations on such an occasion
been so beautiful as this year, for never before had
so many outside friends lent a helping hand. There
was Gordon’s father, so proud that the old high
school was regaining its old reputation, and so
proud and happy because of the share his boy had
had in bringing this about; and there was Reed’s
father, who was but too happy to spend some of his<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
abundant means to make the occasion a memorable
one, not only for his own boy’s sake, but also for the
sake of Stanley Clark, whom he had taken right
into his big heart. And, by the way, he had carried
matters with a high hand, and when he made arrangements
for his boy at Yale, he had made arrangements
for Stanley Clark to go with him, and no
refusals would he listen to for a moment. Clark
had been obliged to give in, and accept the generous
provision, though he did it with a mental vow that
he would pay it all back one of these days.</p>

<p>Then there was Mr. Chase, who was so relieved
and delighted at the improvement in his ward, that
he, too, insisted on “lending a hand” at these Commencement
arrangements. And so it happened that
no graduating class had ever had such beautiful
decorations, such perfect stacks of flowers, or such
fine music as graced this occasion.</p>

<p>And it was Clark who, much against his will, delivered
the oration for the class. He did his best
to get out of it, declaring that it should be given by
Gordon, or Hamlin or St. John; but it was Clark
himself that his classmates now delighted to honor,
and it seemed as if they could not do enough to
make up to him for what was past.</p>

<p>His story had spread through the school, and he
was the unanimous choice of the senior class, so
there was no escape for him, and he was obliged to
be the orator of the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[271]</span></p>

<p>He performed his duty well, as was testified by
the applause that followed, and so many floral tributes
were sent to the stage, that Reed laughingly
told him that he’d have to hire an express wagon to
“tote ’em home.”</p>

<p>But the boy’s glad eyes sought out the spot where
his mother sat with a tall man beside her, a man
whose strong, noble face bore the marks of the sufferings
of the past years.</p>

<p>When it was whispered about that Clark’s father
was there, every boy was wild to see him, and not
one who looked into his face that night but felt
that he was a father to be proud of.</p>

<p>The exercises were over at last. The address to
the graduating class had been made by an eminent
lawyer. The diplomas had been received with more
or less grace and ease, or more or less shyness and
awkwardness.</p>

<p>“Rosy” had distinguished himself by darting out
of the line, as the boys passed forward to receive
their diplomas, and picking up Grace Harlan’s handkerchief,
which he presented to her with his most
fascinating smile.</p>

<p>Then the benediction closed the exercises, and in
a burst of martial music from the orchestra, the
crowd began to disperse.</p>

<p>But the boys of section D lingered still. They realized
now that they could never be all together<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
again, and Mr. Horton, as he clasped one after another
by the hand, found it harder to say “Good-bye”
to this than to any class he had ever before
taught.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I shall dread to go back next year,”
he said, holding Hamlin’s hand, while he laid his
arm affectionately across Clark’s shoulders. “You
boys are going into new scenes, and you will soon
forget the old high school, but I shall be there with
all new faces. Boys&mdash;you don’t know how I am
going to miss you.”</p>

<p>They crowded about him then, realizing, as they
had not done before, how real and true was his
interest in them&mdash;his friendship for them&mdash;realizing,
too, that the great days of our lives, though full
of sunshine, have yet their shadows.</p>

<p>But they were boys, strong, healthy, happy boys,
and life was all before them, with ever new heights
to reach, new prizes to win, and no shadow could
rest long on their young hearts on that glad day.</p>

<p>In the years that followed they made no mean
record in college and in the world, and often Mr.
Horton would read with a happy smile of what one
and another of his boys&mdash;the boys of section D&mdash;had
accomplished out in the great world.</p>
